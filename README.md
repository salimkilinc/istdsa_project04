For our fourth projects at Istanbul Data Science Academy's Data Science Bootcamp, each member of Team-2 has chosen to work independently. This is my fourth project where I went through all the steps of a topic modeling project.

In this project, which I simply call 'Restaurant Review Summarizer', a splendid restaurant aims to thoroughly examine customer reviews on its online platform, sorting them into distinct themes for a more detailed analysis. They have sought my assistance in this effort.

You can explore the entire analysis by reviewing the project files, or you can refer to my Medium article for detailed explanations: https://medium.com/@salimkilinc/unleashing-the-power-of-natural-language-processing-restaurant-review-summarizer-feae43d3cc14

You can also utilize the model I developed in this project through the Streamlit application: https://restaurantreviewsummarizer.streamlit.app
