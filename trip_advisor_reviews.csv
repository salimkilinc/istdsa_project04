65496e562042bfa2da026c03,quince great yet again we are currently doing our swan song regarding our favorite restaurant in san francisco for year we were in that city at least once a month and always enjoyed our dining there those business trip are winding down a my wife corporate office have moved to chicago so our trip to san francisco are slowing coming to an end we have set out to dine at our favorite restaurant in that great dining city and quince ha always been at the top of our list a sommelier friend gave me the name quince at pacific ave by chef michael tusk you must dine there i took him at his word and did so shortly after they opened unfortunately my wife had a dinner meeting that evening so i wa solo she wa able to sneak in and have some wine with me a i wa finishing up the tasting menu i knew that i had to return and with her soon i did over the year we have watched them expand the restaurant and gain michelin star along we way we have had many excellent meal there a well a having attended several culinary event such a chef michael anthony of gramercy tavern in nyc each meal each visit ha been extraordinary and then there are the wonderful wine pairing quince quickly became our favorite restaurant in san francisco and one of our favorite around the world this august visit wa no different than all of the rest and i wa able to dine with my wife for the entire meal which is always a big plus for me the restaurant is lovely on the inside with a sense of refined elegance in every aspect the staff wa wonderful a always and so wa the meal the chef tasting menu and a per our usual the sommelier wine pairing the lighting is subdued but one can still easily take in the culinary artistry appearing before them the dish are all a sight to behold but unlike some chef michael tusk doe not resort to cryo or pyro technics but just artistically created plating and food the table are well spaced so service is easy even in the banquette seating area which we had near the front entrance and in the main dining room the noise level is usually quite low and wa on this visit it wa easy to hear the description of each dish and each wine with the table spacing we could barely hear anything else in the room just a lovely evening also the floral arrangement were magnificent their menu change with the season and often with even greater regularity depending on what chef tusk ha available some year ago they created quince farm so have a more constant supply of various item but then there are still the season so the menu will change most of their menu showcase the produce from the farm and then much of the rest is locally sourced so it can depend on what is ready to come to the table we did the full tasting menu an abbreviated version is available in their salon with course and two amuse bouche course plus the sommelier wine beverage pairing do not be surprised if a sake or an ale show up at the table which ran right at diner and wa well worth the price now we did start the evening off with a glass each of krug from the champagne cart so that did run the price up a bit each dish wa a culinary and visual delight and each wine beverage complimented each dish wonderfully pacing wa absolute perfection with no pause and nothing rushed at any time our top did accumulate a lot of wine glass we like to save a sip or two just to see how they go with later dish but we still had ample room for the plate and more wine glass service wa flawless and i really appreciate that the sommelier took the time to talk a bit about each wine and why it wa chosen to pair with each dish the stemware wa all zalto or riedel and every stem wa varietally appropriate to the wine beverage inside lovely to behold hold and sip from a highlight of this visit wa a tour of the kitchen probably the one place where we had never been at quince and an introduction to chef tusk we got to sit at a little table there with our wine and watch the staff in action plus the sommelier remembered that we both loved the philippe colin montrachet and had two glass of that waiting in the kitchen he then had two black wine glass at our table in the dining room and we had to guess the wine thing such a that really add to the overall dining experience a beautiful evening with my beautiful wine in a very refined and elegant setting with fantastic food just

65496e562042bfa2da026dfb,just another great meal winesin august we were back in san francisco for meeting for my wife this ha been a constant for plus year with at least once per month business trip and sometimes more many more those are winding down a her corporate office are moving to chicago so we have been doing our swan song of san francisco dining making sure to get back to our favorite while we still can boulevard at mission st not too far from the ferry plaza building and the bay ha been one of our favorite over the year since we first discovered it well we did not actually discover it per se a one of my wife san francisco co worker first recommended it and we sort of filed the name away for later then a year later a friend who is a sommelier in san francisco said you must visit boulevard for their wine but do stay for the food two recs and we booked boulevard for the next trip we did go for the wine and stayed for chef nancy oakes food that wa probably about visit ago scattered several month apart this visit wa just under month since we had last dined there often i have to meet my wife for dinner a her meeting always seem to run over this visit to boulevard wa an exception and i think that it wa the first time that we walked through the door together at least in many year we were seated at a small table along the window looking out onto mission st with a view of the open kitchen to my left and to much of the main dining room over the year we have ordered la carte but also enjoyed chef oakes seasonal tasting menu which is what we decided on this visit while maybe not truly farm to table chef oakes mostly doe local sourcing such a the monterey bay octopus on the tasting menu the wine that were part of that initial recommendation were still on the list in some instance we have turned the sommelier loose to pair the wine but a boulevard ha a very good half bottle list that wa the direction i went with a we often dine a a couple a workable list of half bottle will allow me to do my own pairing without sacrificing to a b t g list though boulevard is a good one or having to pair just the perfect bottle with all dish and especially a tasting menu all of the dish were very good plated beautifully and in keeping with the summer season our service wa perfect and the pacing ideal no long pause or rushed aspect the wine service wa excellent and the stemware very nice the only little complaint that i had wa that this table wa small but almost all along the exterior wall are i like the two booth across the aisle from where we sat but then one back is to the open kitchen this table would have been problematic if we had gone with the sommelier wine pairing but with just glass each we managed fine the lighting is good and we had the benefit of the early evening sky through the window the noise level rose to about moderate and especially when the little bar toward the front of the restaurant filled up still easy conversation wa possible there is seating at the front of the restaurant but i find that with it proximity to the bar it can get a bit loud plus patron entering the restaurant walk right beside your table i prefer the area to the rear closest to the kitchen a it is usually quieter and ha far far le foot traffic i am not sure if well make it back but hope to at least once more before all of our trip point toward chicago instead of san francisco either way i will toast chef oakes and boulevard and also our sommelier friend who said to go for the wine but stay for the food how correct she wa more,just another

65496e562042bfa2da026eaf,this restaurant ha rave review and on hand i can see why a the food is good however our experience wa not the best we had visited fog harbour year ago on our honeymoon and wanted to share the experience with our son on our return the restaurant ha changed which we expected but no for the best they started well we were seated my wife didn t like the table and they moved u fog harbour is a popular restaurant and to get another table wa great our server brought our menu and some table water and left first thing i noticed the menu doesn t have all the drink being a non drinker and having a year old we fancied a pepsi coke they have these but none listed weird we were allowed a free starter a per a discount book and the waitress checked on this for u they confirmed we could my wife and son then ordered there starter but asked if we could have a bit longer for main a few minute later my free starter had come out but not my wife or son i started eating and then minute later the rest of the starter arrived i noticed around the restaurant that a few table being seated were given bread roll and butter on arrival then minute into u eating our starter our main arrived not our regular server and i wa quite surprised i told the gentleman we were still eating our starter and to take them back he looked confused but did it by this point we had been in the restaurant minute it felt very rushed for a restaurant where you can pay upto for a main it felt like they wanted to turn table more than let you experience the meal it felt like an expensive fast food restaurant when you pay the price that they charge dining experience should be relaxed enjoy the experience this wa like an expensive table turn never have i experienced something like this at a supposedly up market restaurant we explained the situation about the main with our server and she said that wa strange we finished our starter and our server asked if we wanted our main now most restaurant we ve eaten in usually give you a few minute before serving main but knowing that they were sitting on the side in the kitchen to be served we felt obliged to say yes i noticed more table getting bread roll and butter on arrival actually every table had got them since they had all been new after u so i asked someone a they walked past he confirmed it wa complimentary and everyone got it would we like it at that point i declined a we were halfway through our main then a minute later our main server came over and mentioned that i had asked about it no apology or she had made a mistake which would have been fine she preceded to lie right to our face and said everyone had asked for it which wa a lie because people were getting it a soon a they were seated at the point i told her she wa lying and stop the conversation i then asked to see the manager mario the manager came over and by this time we had been in the restaurant for an hour i mean it wa ridiculous how quick this meal had gone i explained the situation to mario about the meal coming out quickly and the lack of bread roll initially he tried to explain that in the u that food is brought out when it is ready now having visited the u numerous time over the year from east to west north to south that is rubbish my wife mentioned that we had visited previously although year ago and then he questioned if that wa correct a he had only been there year i mean come on mario thing do exist before you found them he admitted with the bread roll that the server had lied and if she had apologised it would have been better i wasn t complaining for a discount but to help develop staff if you can t admit to a mistake how can you learn if she had apologised and said it wa an error i would have still tipped to because she wa attentive but to lie to a customer is wrong mario offered a discount but i wasn t doing this for a discount i wa annoyed at being lied to so declined the discount on the whole we were treated differently to everyone else and having a wife and son of an ethnic origin this annoys me more that most the food is good not great for the price they charge i honestly would shop around

is not intimate it is crowded with small table pushed close together conversation with the person across from me wa difficult at best a loud see and be seen place that seems all too typical in san francisco now this is what unwashed diner in the city want i guess food wa good if a bit over priced given the size of the portion wine were decent pours by the glass and at reasonable price suggest trying the sparkling malbec ro dry hint of the grape skin nice finish in trying to find a real argentine style empanada gonna have to keep looking while the mostly vegetarian filling in the hongo wa

served in the style of many buenos aire eatery with the hot mushroom on the bottom and a cold bed of arugula on top with the seco de carne beef short rib wa a polenta i wish i could make this wa probably the highlight creamy but not too creamy with garlic and a wine reduction drizzle service wa awful our waiter initially talked up the argentina angle but then pushed peruvian ceviche on u we passed yeah it s a latin or south american dish one can also find in place that feature cuisine from ecuador chile colombia and even mexico but it ain t typically argentine the staff wa in a hurry a

very friendly host offered u a glass of wine a we waited made suggestion kept u apprised of table status it s a small downstairs location one long communal table down the center surrounded by old fashioned cubby quasi booth really table and chair separated by wall nice old time vibe it loud friendly lotsa pizza order hostess bus waitperson who brought dessert all very friendly smiling our main waitperson appeared to be the only staffer we saw who never smiled no suggestion no helpful comment we d ask is x good she d say yes i finally asked are you going to just say everything s good and got a tight grin a a response chianti recommended by hostess wa good menu is very minimal name of dish minimal or no description of ingredient or preparation they put some very hot bread on the table nice that it wa very fresh but it a mushy soft tasteless white bread reminiscent of something you can buy frozen at the grocery store and bake yourself had to ask for a refill and refill came partially warm partially chilled they re definitely baking from pre made whether pre made in house or purchased can t tell i started with carpaccio generous portion but nothing noteworthy no offer of bread others ordered baked fresh clam no description on menu other than a specialty traditional italian baked clam are topped with bread crumb herb laid out etc this wa a bowl of clam in a broth much more

sliced eggplant dipped in egg batter fried then laid out in a casserole with sauce and cheese this wa just sliced eggplant a relatively tasteless marinara and cheese result mushy eggplant not bad but not much better than a frozen entree a side of lukewarm penne topped with about tb of the same marinara wa plopped down beside it i didn t know it wa coming or might have asked for an option rather than exact same sauce a eggplant others pasta side served at the table had much more sauce and were hotter a a result the seafood pasta ordered by another wa much better two said their rolletini wa

it two michelin star but instead of working hard to win that back they seemed to just be phoning it all in on this visit it seemed that the excitement had drained from the menu dish were ok but all lacked any spirit and the texture were all wrong just too amorphous to work the same could be said for the color mostly brown and grey nothing wa badly missing but nothing wa stellar a we had come to

65496e592042bfa2da0272ff,once upon a time in the city of san francisco a place renowned for it culinary diversity and vibrant dining scene i embarked on an evening at the esteemed tadich grill brimming with anticipation my party and i sauntered into the restaurant eagerly awaiting a culinary experience that had been lauded for it historical significance and gastronomic delight a we settled into our seat the initial charm of the restaurant enveloped u the vintage decor aged wood and murmur of lively conversation whisked u away to a time when hospitality wa an art form practiced with reverence and dedication but ala dear reader our fleeting sense of enchantment wa soon shattered like a fragile champagne flute dropped on the cold unforgiving kitchen floor upon perusing the menu we discovered that not everyone in our group wa inclined to indulge in a full fledged dinner some among u perhaps le ravenous or with dietary restriction sought only to sample the appetizer and drink that tadich grill had to offer a simple request we thought for any dining establishment that prided itself on being a beacon of hospitality yet a the evening unfurled it became glaringly evident that the power that be at tadich grill had forgotten the very essence of hospitality choosing instead to wield their authority with a heavy hand and an iron will like a sommelier refusing to pour a glass of wine for a parched soul the manager emerged from the shadow casting his disapproving gaze upon u with a tone a frigid a the fog rolling in from the bay he unceremoniously declared that we were not welcome to occupy our table unless all member of our party partook in the sacred ritual of ordering a full meal the callousness of the proclamation left u stunned our sense of disbelief matched only by the audacity of the decree itself in that moment i yearned for the day of old when the sanctity of the dining table reigned supreme and the customer wa revered a royalty a time when a matre d would have charmed u with his suave demeanor seating u with a flourish and a smile regardless of our culinary inclination a time when the staff s aim wa not merely to fill table but to fill heart with joy and delight i pondered how tadich grill a bastion of tradition had strayed so far from the true essence of hospitality a restaurant that had witnessed generation of diner breaking bread and forging memory now chose to cast aside potential patron merely because their desire did not align with a rigid outdated model good service my dear reader transcends the perfunctory act of placing plate before patron and whisking them away when empty it resides in the warmth of a welcoming smile the attentiveness to individual need and the genuine desire to make every guest feel special regardless of their appetite ala tadich grill s misguided stance left a bitter taste in my mouth not from the fare they served but from the disheartening realization that they had lost sight of what it truly meant to treat customer with the respect and consideration they deserved a i departed from that storied establishment i couldn t help but wonder if the ghost of bygone culinary legend wept at the state of hospitality in the present day may this lament serve a a reminder to all who enter the realm of gastronomy it is not just the food that leaf a lasting impression but the graciousness and hospitality bestowed upon every soul that cross the threshold more,once upon a time in the city of san  a place renowned for it culinary diversity and vibrant dining scene i  on an evening at the   grill brimming

he unceremoniously declared that we were not welcome to occupy our table unless all member of our party partook in the sacred ritual of  a full meal the callousness of the proclamation left u  our sense of disbelief  only by the audacity of the decree itself in that moment i  for the day of old when the sanctity of the dining table  supreme and the customer wa revered a royalty a time when a  d would have  u with his suave demeanor seating u with a flourish and a smile regardless of our culinary inclination a time when the staff s aim wa not merely to fill table but to fill heart with joy and delight i  how  grill a bastion of tradition had  so far from the true essence of hospitality a restaurant that had  generation of diner breaking bread and forging memory now chose to cast aside potential patron merely because their desire did not align with a rigid outdated model good service my dear reader  the perfunctory act of  plate before patron and whisking them away when empty it  in the warmth of a welcoming smile the attentiveness to individual need and the genuine desire to make every guest feel special regardless of their appetite ala  grill s misguided stance left a bitter taste in my mouth not from the fare they  but from the disheartening realization that they had lost sight of what it truly meant to treat customer with the respect and consideration they deserved a i departed from that storied establishment i  t help but wonder if the ghost of bygone culinary legend wept at the state of hospitality in the present day may this lament serve a a reminder to all who enter the realm of gastronomy it is not just the food that leaf a lasting impression but the graciousness and hospitality  upon every soul that cross the threshold more

decided on laurenz v singing grner veltliner from the short but interesting wine list i wa really not in the mood for asian though i wa seated in an asian restaurant and bar a we had done thai and japanese for three dinner already yet i had read so much about e o that i wa determined to eat lunch there i mentioned my dilemma to the bartender and he highly recommended their e o cheeseburger on house made scallion bun with white cheddar kim chi sriracha aioli house made pickle and togarashi fry sounded good so i ordered that along with a glass of trig point diamond dust alexander valley cabernet sauvignon i hesitated over the robert biale black chicken vineyard zinfandel but a i have case of that in my cellar back in phoenix decided on a wine that i had never tasted and the trig point wa one turned out to be a good pairing with the cheeseburger now the cheeseburger is a monster and it had to be cut to be eaten the burger patty wa cooked perfectly and wa tasty and juicy the bun wa also very good a were the cheddar and kim chi sriracha aioli the fry seemed to have been hand cut and not out of a lb sack from the freezer a great burger and i would rank it about or on my continuing burger quest in san francisco this wa a burger worth returning for and in an asian restaurant the restaurant did fill up with lunch time diner and it seemed that the staff knew most of them so i would say many were returning local always a good sign the noise level rose a bit but not too badly given the crowd the lighting over the bar wa more than adequate and i have to give the bartender credit for still checking on me even when the crowd picked up the main dining room wa smallish but looked comfortable with good lighting too i saw a balcony but do not know if there wa additional dining upstairs or if this wa just an architectural element the dcor wa very tasteful and maybe even a tad understated attractive i have another lunch option in san francisco though our trip are winding down now and would not hesitate to order the cheeseburger again even in this asian restaurant more,great cheeseburger at an   were  around the corner from e o  kitchen at  st at the
