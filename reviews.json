{"review":"Having lived in the Bay Area for 30+ years I regret not finding out about this place sooner. Treasure Island has such unique views of the SF skyline, from the waterfront to the Golden Gate Bridge all the way around to the Bay Bridge, \n\nMersea...has a super laid-back vibe with incredible food and drinks and the most outrageous view of the SF skyline,  a full 270 degree water view with floor to ceiling windows. \n\nDaniel makes an incredible Manhattan, and the poke was super fresh.  Meesun was an amazing hostess and made sure we ordered all the house specials\u2026Truffle fries, Fish and Chips etc etc. Mmmmm!! We will definitely be back soon!More"}
{"review":"Long time diner, first time reviewer. I\u2019ve been coming to Mersea for years and it never fails to impress.  My go to is the fish and chips but I sampled several other dishes on my last visit. The fish chowder was the best that I...have ever had with large delicious chunks of fish and vegetables that melted in my mouth. The cauliflower, fish tacos, carnitas tacos, and brownies were also fantastic! I ate way too much and it was totally worth the trip. I will be back again very soon.More"}
{"review":"The view, the staff, the ceviche and the fish & chips were the best I've encountered in years! My new favorite place to escape Marin and the city and enjoy a moment of island life!"}
{"review":"My brother-in-law loves Fish and Chips.  We heard that Mersea on Treasure Island had the best in the area.  The rumors were accurate.  The portion was huge and delightfully crispy on the outside (they make it with Haddock!!) and moist and juicy on the inside....The potatoes were authentic, but we still had to get the truffle fries.  The fish chowder was out of this world.  All in all, a great experience that will be repeated.More"}
{"review":"The food is always great! I always start with the chowder and the rest of the menu is just delicious,all pleasingly so. Great location, usually enjoy an afternoon, and walk the island perimeter, then back to Mersea for another sipping of something hot or cold...(desert) before heading on. Have been coming here for years since just before landscape by the Half Moon Bay Gal started showing up. Beautiful , (check it out) ! Kids and Pets friendly! (See Check Please Bay Area episode) , how I discovered Mersea! Thanks for being there! Yours,R.F. Napa,caMore"}
{"review":"I'm not sure how this place has been rated so high.  Fish and chips were flavorless and mushy, and potatoes were bland and cut way too big for my taste. Husband had Poke bowl, looked beautiful,  trying to hard to recreate something that on its...own is spectacular and also bland. Service was decent, nice bar selection. Need some more shade.More"}
{"review":"Nice people, great food and super location.\nWe went for a great lunch opposite dt San Fransisco.\nHighly recommended if you have a car. Not much to see on Treasure island otherwise, except the view towards the city, but so much worth going for a...snack or lunch.More"}
{"review":"We had a spectacular day at Mersea yesterday. It turned out to be one of the busiest days of the year on the bay \u201cFleet Week\u201d! We had brilliant sunshine, sensational cocktails - LOVE the Margherita with cucumber and jalape\u00f1o was refreshing\u2026 while watching The...Blue Angels streak through the sky. The restaurant is located right opposite the city and Golden Gate Bridge - the perfect location for us foreigners - Australians and Germans to enjoy the best of SF bay! The Ceviche was delicious and enjoyed the  fish and chips! \nDrinks were quick and food a little delayed as it was such a popular spot that day but it all came out hot and fresh. The service so friendly. Thankful for a perfect day!More"}
{"review":"When we have visitors, we take them to Mersea. When we are meeting friends we haven't seen in awhile, we take them to Mersea. When we need a break from San Francisco, we take ourselves to Mersea. \n\nWe took friends from York, England to Mersea...Friday, September 22. The food was as spectacular as the view. To say they loved it, would be an understatement. They said that it was one of the highlights of their visit! \nMeesun, one of the owners, came by the table to check on us and chat. When she learned that our friends were from England, she returned with a sample of their fish and chips to see how it stood up to the British version. One friend who doesn't care for fish and chips, said he was converted by Mersea's. \n\nWe were there for lunch. It was Friday and beautiful. There was a live band playing. Views, great food and friends. What more can you ask for? Another reason to come back...More"}

Not only was the location fun with a great view of the city, but the staff were so friendly and the food was incredible.

A lovely evening all round!More"}

There was live music in the afternoon.  The owner...came to the tables to make sure everything was good and took pictures of our group. And the food and drinks were wonderful and very reasonably priced. Can't wait to come back to San Francisco,  will be one of my first stops!More"}
{"review":"What an amazing experience we had at Mersea. I\u2019m so glad we listened to a friend\u2019s reco to check it out. Such a unique setting and experience. And the best part\u2026the food was outstanding. We decided on lunch since that fit best with our travel...schedule, and it was perfect. We were making our way from Napa down to San Diego and this was the best dining we had throughout a mix of upscale and casual experiences. Amazing views of the harbor. Beautiful location. And the food was so amazing we just kept ordering. Paired our lunch with a wonderful bottle of rose. If you are in the San Fran area it\u2019s a \u201cmust try\u201d.  Don\u2019t let the no-reservations stop you.  Lunch was a great California casual option. Live music outside and an afternoon view of the full harbor. Staff was all smiles, attentive and incredibly knowledgeable about their rose!More"}

Unpretentious restaurant and prices fair.\n\nFood was pretty good especially the Bruschetta starter, but not exceptional and maybe we  were hoping for something more based on its high rating.

Luisa was sitting at the door making sure that the staff were attentive to the patrons as only an Italian matriarch can do.\n\nEverything we had was great. This included...the house made garlic bread, the succulent carpaccio and Parma pizza. This was enough for two of us and we left quite happy.\n\nWe would definitely visit Luisa's again if in the area.More"}

{"review":"Family friendly & incredible food that is also affordable in comparison to other comparable restaurants. We didn\u2019t realize her daughter\u2019s restaurant was Paisanos in pacifica. When Luisa said it was her daughter we said\u2026that makes complete sense! We had been going to Luisa\u2019s and Paisanos...for years before we moved away from the Bay Area. It\u2019s funny that we had no idea that they were family. Tonight We enjoyed the gnocchi (my husband said it is THE BEST), manicotti (so amazing with the vodka sauce), and vodka sauce spaghetti (7 year old daughter who is a very picky eater loved it) were amazing. To end, we had the tiramisu and lemon cake- incredible. The best tiramisu we\u2019ve had yet. We also absolutely loved the woodwork Pinot noir with our dishes. You cannot miss this spot!More"}

{"review":"I've been hanging around The Castro in San Francisco off and on since 1982 (and lived there from 1985-1994) so I was absolutely sure I knew all there was to know, even with the changes that naturally occur over the years.  Last week I reconnected...with an old friend (since 1974) whom I hadn't seen in 29 years - thank heaven he knew more than I did, and he took me to this extraordinary place - still technically in The Castro, but up the hill and around the corner from all \"the action\" in an old Victorian building.  We were greeted personally with handshakes by the manager - and the evening blossomed from there. The manager and staff are French - and clearly the chef is.  The wine suggestions were spot on (and not something I would have chosen) to go with the food - and such food! We tasted a bit of everything, but I have to say that this was the best Coq au vin I've ever had  - yes, even in Paris - with the tender meat melting off the bone into a complex wine sauce. And in the French tradition, though the place was PACKED the entire time we were there, we had no sense of being rushed and had literally two hours to sit and catch up on the years we've missed seeing each other.  And to top it all off, the cost was extraordinarily reasonable for the food and location.  If you like French food this is the place to go - take the Market Street trolley from wherever you're staying downtown, get off at the end of the line and walk a block over and up the hill - it's worth it!More"}
{"review":"This is our 2 time dining there. It is an outstanding spot. Excellent food. Everything we ordered was a wow!!\nThe service was excellent as well. Felt like we were dining in France!\nOutstanding!!!!!"}

{"review":"We live in the neighborhood and this is always a special treat. Steak with Frites or Roasted Chicken on a cold foggy night."}
{"review":"We were delighted to rediscover this intimate French restaurant.  Wife and I made reservations through Open Table for a week night and were promptly seated.  The menu was not extensive but well chosen, real French fare including escargot, coq au vin, duck confit, etc. No...full bar, but a good wine list including excellent kier royale.  We were served with excellent French bread and butter without having to order it separately, which is the usual practice nowadays. Wife and I ordered their butter lettuce salad, which was very fresh, with excellent olive oil dressing with anchovies.  The escargot in potato cups and delicious green sauce was innovative and flavorful.  The coup de grace were the main courses \u2013 wife ordered the Chilean sea bass special, which was outstandingly flavorful and cooked just right, as was the rack of lamb I ordered, rare as I wanted, with an outstanding flavorful wine sauce.  The accompanying vegetables and potatoes were also tasty and we cleaned our rather sumptuous plates.  For dessert, we ordered the floating island, which we love but have not found on the menu in any other French restaurant so far.  The islands puff pastries floated in wonderful creamy sauce before vanishing into our appreciative mouths.  The service was attentive, friendly, and professional.  Overall, a wonderful authentic French bistro, which we intend to frequent.More"}
{"review":"I really read reviews of restaurants in United States. We live in the San Francisco Bay area and I almost never read reviews from restaurants here.\n\nI love this restaurant. I like the buzz food was excellent wait staff was on point. There\u2019s nothing not...to like.\n\nI have the shrimp raviolis as a starter. My wife had the escargot. Both fairly unusual and perfectly executed. Honestly, outstanding.\n\nI have the coq au vin which was fine. I\u2019m not sure I would get it again. My wife had the lamb which was over the top. She is a lamb connoisseur and thought it was one of the best preparation she\u2019s had in many years. The potatoes were over the top too. Next time we\u2019re going to split that dish. There will be a next time.\n\nI highly recommend this restaurant.More"}

{"review":"We were disappointed with the food here.  We each had a fish entree, salmon and sea bass.  They were okay, but nothing special at all."}
{"review":"Wife and I made reservations through Open Table and were promptly seated.  They do not have a full bar \u2013 we began with kier royale which was excellent.  For appetizers, wife had their special tomato salad, which was excellent; I had their soup of the...day (mushroom) which was quite tasty, and the escargot, which had an interesting green sauce encased in fried potato cups \u2013 this was intriguing and delicious but I wished there were more escargots (I think there were 3 or 4).  The main courses were the most outstanding- rack of lamb for wife, and the duck confit for me.  They were perfectly cooked, and had wonderful flavor and sauce, though wife wished there was a bit more sauce on the lamb. We shared the floating island for dessert which was quite creamy and delicious.  The service was reasonably prompt and attentive, and the glass of red wine he recommended was excellent. Of note is that this is a rather small and intimate restaurant, and the gentlemen in the next table started a conversation with us which was welcome as they had very similar tastes as us concerning gourmet restaurants.  Overall a quite satisfactory dining experience.More"}
{"review":"We have been coming to this restaurant for the last five years. On average twice a month for dinner. We always order the filet mignon. In general, we were happy with service and the meal. Unfortunatelly, last night (05\/30\/2020), we ordered two takeout filet mignons...and to our surprise when we arrived home and started to enjoy our dinner, we realized that we were given two pieces of sirloin steak disguised in the shape of filet mignon medallion. After the first bite, the taste and the texture confirmed it was not what we ordered. We felt cheated and thought this action could be construed as fraud. We contacted the restaurant right away. They provided a lame excuse, blaming Coronavirus and the difficulties of getting their meat supply. What was most insulting to us was that after five years of eating their filet mignon they thought we would not recognized it. The restaurant offered to fully reimburse us but never offered an apology neither recoignized that they may have made an error along the way. I would not recommmend to order filet mignon from this place.More"}

My partner and I had the garlic & parmasian focaccia OMG a must have! & warm olives (very salty) to start, followed by the...American Wagyu Carpoccio & Tomato Braised Polpette (2 very large meatballs, could have stopped hear bc it was filling). My partner had the Orecchiette which is Genovese basil pesto, garlic, cherry tomato, Borlotti beans & breadcrumbs. I had the Triangoli\nWhich is honey nut squash, mascarpone cheese, chive burro fuso and pomegranet seeds THE STAR of the night.  We have been to Italy and tge food was just as good.More"}

{"review":"An amazing dinner. Some of the best pasta I\u2019ve ever had. Wonderful olive oil cake for dessert. If I could give it 4.9 stars I would, just because they sent the food out really quickly and seemed to be in a hurry to get us...out of there. But it was no setback to our meal. Highly recommend, just wanted to add that the service was too quick for the staff who may read this.More"}
{"review":"Arriving was simple for a couple of cable car novice Antipodeans (Australians).  As per concierge's explicit directions we jumped a cable car for the inbound journey.  As per my partners implicit guidance the outbound journey rolling through the hills of Frisco led us to a...cheap gin joint by the Bay.  Eventually located our lodgings in the early hours with guidance from a gentleman bearing a remarkable resemblance to Jack Kerouac who was heavily ensconced at the aforementioned speak easy.  Luckily I took some notes during our dining experience to refresh our taste buds.  A lovely wagyu carpaccio was washed down with a bone dry rose brut.  Pappadelle and lamb, benissimo with a inky barolo.  Bay fish over risotto was moist and delicious.  I would recommend a comfortable pair of shoes if attempting to navigate back to your hotel by foot.More"}
{"review":"This was the busiest restaurant in the area and we now know why. I started with the American Wagyu Carpaccio that was very good and well seasoned. My husband had the Little gem salad that was very good but heavy on the cheese. \nI had...the Squid Ink Pasta special with Dungeness crab, which was divine! I would highly recommend this dish if available again. My husband had the Wagyu flat iron steak that he enjoyed. The lovely fresh asparagus and fingerling potato garnish were delicious also. The Vanilla Panna Cotta and the Chocolate Budino were also delicious desserts. I would definitely return next time we are in San Francisco.More"}
{"review":"The bar features a cozy and intimate atmosphere with dim lighting and comfortable seating. The drink menu is extensive and includes classic cocktails as well as unique creations. The bartenders are skilled and knowledgeable, providing excellent service and recommendations. The bar also offers a small...selection of bar bites, including charcuterie and cheese boards. Overall, House of Nomad Bar is a great spot for a date night or a night out with friends.More"}
{"review":"We had last dined at Seven Hills pre-pandemic, and hoped it was as good. The restaurant was even better, more creative, with incredible dishes. The artichokes and stracciatella incorporated unexpected flavors, innovative and perfect. Fresh and tender tagliatelle with lamb sausage was enveloped in pecorino....Most memorable was the fusilli infused with walnut pesto and entwined with heirloom brocolli and fresh herb sprigs. Focaccia bread pudding swimming in creme anglais, sublime. Service was welcoming, as was the ambiance.More"}
{"review":"The ambience is very nice and the food is heavenly. The carpaccio for an app was delicious. We then had the Amatriciana pasta and the Papardelle. This were just out of this world. We shared both so they brought them in sequence. Portions are not...huge so you can taste a little of everything. We ended dinner with the chocolate buoudini\u2026 just amazing. This was one of the best dinner experiences in a long time. Will come back!More"}

This Seven Hills restaurant on the way to Fisherman's Wharf...is better than any Michelin star restaurant anywhere and we can afford it to eat regularly without any problem. Thank you Alexis for giving us such an excellent meal and excellent truly genuine service. I promise we will be back for more before we leave San Francisco. \n\nMaggieMore"}
{"review":"We had an excellent experience at this restaurant. The manager, Abraham, is simply outstanding and needs to be specifically recognized.\n\nThe meal was excellent. We shared the carpaccio which was fairly petite but outstanding. The flavors were unusual, not typical, and superb. There after, we...shared the meatballs which were absolutely non-typical. They had a little bit of cheese inside and the accompanying tomato sauce was perfectly on point. Finally, we shared the functional equivalent of spinach ravioli. Another excellent dish.  \n\nOur server was excellent.\n\nParking at this restaurant is a serious problem. That said, it should not dissuade one from patronizing the establishment.\n\nI highly recommend this restaurant.More"}

Two coffes and...a single juice for the kids. \nThey also add a mandatory 20 % tip if there are 4 or more of you and while the service was okay, it certainly wasn't worth 20%.More"}

{"review":"Was walking towards Pier 39 from Chinatown when I saw some people entering Mo's & followed in! \n\nPeople were friendly & gave a nice welcome. It wasn't too busy when I arrived but it got busier with more arrivals as the morning progressed. \n\nI ordered...a spicy pork chop with eggs done sunny side up. All the egg dishes come with fried potatoes & bread (toast or English muffins). Also got a coffee. \n\nA quick look round at what other people had ordered showed that it all looked amazing & generous! \n\nIt took a while for the food to arrive & when it did, I could understand why - the pork chop was a thick & massive hunk of meat, so it must have taken sometime to cook. The portion was huge! \n\nThe fried potatoes were really good - nice & crisp on the outside as it should be & garnished with chives. \n\nThe pork chop was well-seasoned & tasty but it wasn't spicy & there was a bit which was a tad undercooked. The eggs were perfect with the yolks still runny. \n\nThe sourdough toast were a tad hard but otherwise not too bad with butter & strawberry jam. There were free refills of coffee & iced water. \n\nThe vibe of the place was really nice & cosy & there were seats at the counter as well. It felt a bit like a modernised, more fashionable version of a traditional American diner, judging by the clientele. Although the place got busier, I never felt rushed to finish my food & vacate the table for other patrons. \n\nOverall, I really liked Mo's. It was such a lucky find as I was in need of breakfast & am glad I managed to try a fry-up in a diner. \n\nDefo recommend a visit when you're in town!More"}

For example: when we sat down he was making a drink that was beautiful...and interesting to me. When I asked him what it was he told me the name of it with an accent that I didn\u2019t understand. When I asked him to explain it In English, he slammed the cocktail menu in front of me and pointed to the drink.

{"review":"Good service, terrible food. There were no prices on the menu for wine. The burger we ordered was cooked dry, flavourless, stale bread, and even the tomato and lettuce didn't taste good.

{"review":"What a wonderful breakfast spot - well placed near Union Square. We would highly recommend the Avocado Toast - which had well balanced flavours, and was served in a good portion size. The classic breakfast items like fried eggs, bacon and toast, were done to...a high standard. The menu is wide and diverse and you could have chosen something exciting and new every day for a month! The gluten free provision is great, with gluten free toast available and various items that can be made gluten free.\n\nService was quick and friendly - with food flying out of the kitchen after 10-15 minutes; despite a mostly full restaurant. \n\nThank you for a great experience Lapisara, and we would highly recommend.More"}
{"review":"Wonderful casual spot with friendly and attentive staff!  Great meal!  Eclectic menu with a number of very creative options!"}
{"review":"So glad I decided to give Lapisara a try. Service was excellent - from the warm welcome when I stepped into the restaurant to the solicitous care from multiple staff members, it was quite amazing given how busy they were on a Sunday morning. Space...is small and a bit of a squeeze but no one seemed to mind because the food (and service) was generous and so good. And the vibe was just positive and conducive to conversation over a good meal. \n\nI tried the Holy Chili Bomb Basil Omelette, which was presented most prettily on a plate with dainty edible florals. It was essentially a spicy Thai Basil Ground Chicken (or Gai Pad Krapow) wrapped in an omelette. I had enough to make two meals.\n\nGreat job Lapisara! If I'm in the area again, I will be a repeat customer.More"}

{"review":"This Michelin three star restaurant is excellent and worthy of its three stars.  We had what seemed like a 50 course meal (not really but it seemed that way).  At the end we could not even eat the last course, the squab.  Everything was excellent...from all of the many dishes, including the two desserts. Service was also excellent.  The wine paring was among the best parings with lots of interesting wines.  We also had the white truffle pasta which was good, however not a standout.  The bill for two was approximately $2,200 with tax and tip.  A lot for sure, but it was a memorable meal.More"}
{"review":"Perhaps my disappoint was that Quince mostly failed my expectations but rather it didn\u2019t live up to what their promise is. \nService was great, staff were generally knowledgeable and helpful. \nWe had the truffle and the wine pairing and the extra offering of the added...pasted course. \nThe truffle was certainly underwhelming. I barely smelled the flavor on most of the courses. \nThe redeeming dishes were limited. Perhaps what stood out was the desert.  \nThe wine pairing was literally terrible.  Nine of us finished our glasses and we usually drink wine by the case!! \nBread was delicious!! LolMore"}
{"review":"Quince reopened this week and it was as if they never left.  We were pleased to be able to choose the 4 course option as 9 courses sometimes feel like too much.\n\nWe started with the beautiful canapes then to the caviar. The brioche was...melt in your mouth delicious.  Then on to the pasta course with bone marrow and we ordered the supplemental beef which was amazing.\n\nWe asked about a cheese course and while it isn't back yet, they did bring us a plate prior to dessert. \n\ndessert was light and fresh. We felt very taken care of and no change in the 3 Michelin Star service.More"}

{"review":"I was previously lucky enough to eat at Quince in their private dining room - that experience was fabulous. This time around I took a colleague for dinner at the last minute. The staff were, as before, charming and inviting. The space is warm and...welcoming and very comfortable. We both opted for the tasting menu with some additional wine pairings (and some additional additional pairings along the way!) Plenty of reviews have been written about the delicious food. What I want to mention is the quiet attention given by the staff to identify what a diner has really enjoyed and to further encourage that enjoyment: our waiter noticed that I\u2019d really delighted in one of the dishes and another of the wine pairings. Without any request on my part an additional variant of the dish and possible other wine options for that dish appeared - it was fantastic! \n\nThank you all - and best wishes for the future.More"}
{"review":"Quince - Great, Yet Again!\n\nWe are currently doing our \u201cswan song,\u201d regarding our favorite restaurants in San Francisco. For 15 years, we were in that city, at least once a month, and always enjoyed our dining there. Those business trips are winding down, as...my wife\u2019s corporate offices have moved to Chicago, so our trips to San Francisco are slowing coming to an end. We have set out to dine at our favorite restaurants in that great dining city, and Quince has always been at the top of our list.\n\nA Sommelier friend gave me the name - Quince, at 470 Pacific Ave, by Chef Michael Tusk - \u201cyou MUST dine there!\u201d I took him at his word, and did so, shortly after they opened. Unfortunately, my wife had a dinner meeting that evening, so I was solo. She was able to sneak in and have some wine with me, as I was finishing up the Tasting Menu. I knew that I had to return, and with her. Soon, I did. Over the years we have watched them expand the restaurant, and gain Michelin Stars along we way. We have had many excellent meals there, as well as having attended several culinary events, such as Chef Michael Anthony of Gramercy Tavern, in NYC. Each meal, each visit, has been extraordinary, and then, there are the wonderful wine pairings. Quince quickly became our favorite restaurant in San Francisco, and one of our favorites, around the world. This August visit, was no different, than all of the rest, and I was able to dine with my wife, for the entire meal, which is always a big plus for me.\n\nThe restaurant is lovely on the inside, with a sense of refined elegance, in every aspect. The staff was wonderful, as always, and so was the meal - The Chef\u2019s Tasting Menu, and as per our usual, the Sommelier\u2019s Wine Pairings. The lighting is subdued, but one can still easily take in the culinary artistry, appearing before them. The dishes are all a sight to behold, but unlike some chefs, Michael Tusk does not resort to cryo, or pyro-technics, but just artistically created plating and food. The tables are well-spaced, so service is easy, even in the banquette seating areas, which we had, near the front entrance, and in the main dining room. The noise level is usually quite low, and was on this visit. It was easy to hear the description of each dish, and each wine. With the table spacing, we could barely hear anything else in the room. Just a lovely evening. Also, the floral arrangements were magnificent.\n\nTheir menu changes with the seasons, and often with even greater regularity, depending on what Chef Tusk has available. Some years ago, they created Quince Farm, so have a more constant supply of various items, but then, there are still the Seasons, so the menu will change. Most of their menus showcase the produce from the farm, and then much of the rest is locally sourced, so it can depend on what is ready to come to the table.\n\nWe did the full Tasting Menu (an abbreviated version is available in their Salon), with 10 Courses, and two Amuse Bouche Courses, plus the Sommelier\u2019s Wine\/Beverage Pairings (do not be surprised if a Sake, or an Ale shows up at the table), which ran right at $300 + $275\/diner, and was well-worth the price. Now, we did start the evening off with a glass each of Krug, from the Champagne Cart, so that did run the price up a bit. Each dish was a culinary, and visual delight, and each wine\/beverage complimented each dish wonderfully..\n\nPacing was absolute perfection, with no pauses, and nothing rushed, at any time. Our 4-top did accumulate a lot of wine glasses (we like to save a sip, or two, just to see how they go with later dishes), but we still had ample room for the plates, and more wine glasses. Service was flawless, and I really appreciate that the Sommelier took the time to talk a bit about each wine, and why it was chosen to pair with each dish. The stemware was all Zalto, or Riedel, and every stem was varietally appropriate to the wine\/beverage inside - lovely to behold, hold and sip from.\n\nA highlight of this visit was a tour of the kitchen - probably the one place where we had never been at Quince - and an introduction to Chef Tusk. We got to sit at a little table there, with our wine, and watch the staff in action. Plus, the Sommelier remembered that we both loved the Philippe Colin Montrachet, and had two glasses of that waiting in the kitchen! He then had two black wine glasses at our table in the dining room, and we had to guess the wine - things, such as that, really add to the overall dining experience.\n\nA beautiful evening, with my beautiful wine, in a very refined, and elegant setting, with fantastic food - just another perfect evening. Quince is one restaurant, that we would fly to San Francisco, just to dine there - and we have done that for a couple of their special dinners, already. We\u2019re also scheduled to attend a culinary event with Chef Tusk, at a little place in the Smoky Mountains, next Summer.More"}
{"review":"This has to be one of the finest dinning restaurants I've every had the pleasure to dine at.  The food was splendid and me and my wife enjoyed the entire experience."}
{"review":"My wife and I celebrated her 50th birthday at Quince.  It was undeniably the best experience we have ever had at a restaurant.  From the moment we arrived, we were treated with friendly, attentive and accommodating service that went well beyond anything we could have...expected. The restaurant runs like a well oiled machine and all of the staff are top notch.  The food and wine pairings were outstanding and each course was another wonderful new experience.  This is the first review I have ever posted and I was compelled to do so after having the most memorable dining experience ever. Thank you to all the staff who made my wife\u2019s 50th birthday dinner an evening that neither of us will ever forget.  Highly recommended!!!More"}
{"review":"I suspect that the founding father chef Mike Tusk isn't in the kitchen.  The meal started with a vaguely grotesque buddha's hand stuffed with raw fish, and went course by course from there, many things just didn't hit the superb dishes from before.   The food...was vaguely strange, but all was good the service was astounding, as was the place.More"}
{"review":"We celebrated a special occasion here in Sep 2019. The food was fresh, awesome and delicious. Really enjoyed the 2 desserts! We were amazed at the range of mignardise on the cart as well.

Don\u2019t rush, don\u2019t plan anything else for the evening and take it all in.More"}
{"review":"Disappointed for the following reasons:\n1) waiter was cutting the ham for my Pizza one for me one for him straight into his mouth then one for me. Did not wash hands at all.\n2) chefs were eating pizza in Kitchen while preparing pizza for...customers. \n3) waiter cleaned something in his mouth with his finger and then proceed to carry plates out to customers.\nIt was meant to be a pleasant evening out but turned out to be one that I rather forget. When asked why I didn\u2019t finish my pizza I was polite and just said I was just full. And it wasn\u2019t quite too my liking. Which was greeted with I don\u2019t know pizza so how could I comment. I have had the same pizza all over the world and this was the worst.  There are other better places around so please don\u2019t settle.More"}

The gentleman who waited on us was lovely.   A nice bottle of nere d'avola, bread and olive oil....Delicious arugula salad with bresaola  was a good salad to share as a starter.  We both enjoyed our macaroni.   I don't typically get anything with red sauce out because why pay for what I make at home weekly?  But I have a weak spot for pasta ala norma -- penne piccolo forno here.  It did not disappoint.    My husband also enjoyed his ravioli.    We were too full and tired for dessert, but may make a trip back later in the week for affogato.More"}

{"review":"This was the only restaurant we visited twice while staying in San Francisco principally because it offered the best value for money dining we experienced. \n\nThe restaurant was popular with a nice atmosphere set back from some of the more commercial and variable quality restaurants...on the Wharf.\n\nGood food choice and drinks menus. We went for Millionaire's Bacon Sampler and Dolsot Bibimbap which was enough for two people. \n\nWalk-Ins were accepted and staff were both attentive and polite. \n\nGreat choice for mid-priced dining.More"}

{"review":"I arrived with a large group just before around 5:45pm and we were seated right away by a welcoming staff. For starters, we had the crispy tofu salad and their Millionaire Bacon, which is one of the things they\u2019re known for. Both were amazing!! The...greens were tossed in a sesame ginger dressing and served with avocado and pickled red onions. Now, let\u2019s talk about the bacon. Simply put: plain perfection. Thick and crispy and it basically melted in my mouth. The appetizer brings two strips and is served on a bed of asparagus. \n\nThe entree menu has something for everyone: Korean fried chicken, noodle and rice dishes, soups, tacos, etc. I opted for the bulgogi japchae and it did not disappoint. Lots of bulgogi and noodles, all served on a bed of rice. Outright perfect. Entree portions are large, so don\u2019t fill up on appetizers!\n\nBy the time we left around 7:15pm, the restaurant was full. I suggest making a reservation if you plan on visiting at peak dinner time. Service overall was very good.More"}

A little on the pricy side, but the portion size was large,...and everything was delicious. It's definitely worth a breakfast visit. \n\nDinner\nWent back for dinner a few nights later. The food was still good but not as good as the breakfast offering. The biggest issue was service, they bring your meal out SO fast, we had an appetiser to share and 2 mains with drinks but only stayed in the restaurant for 30 minutes. They need to slow things down and bit and let people enjoy a more leisurely dinner. I'd give dinner a miss in future.More"}

There's plenty to choose from on a very entertaining menu ranging from spicy pork Bap to Kimchi fried rice...to the Korean fried chicken (seems to be the most popular).\nThe spices and taste combinations are totally unique from other asian dishes. The portions are PLENTIFUL and service quick and friendly. The Pimped UP Ramyun combines just about all the Korean textures, tastes and aroma. Delicious.\nVery knowledgable servers.\nOutdoors in the season affords an excellent view of the wild variety of individuals making their way to enjoy or work at the Wharf below.\nWine and  Beer.  \nPrices extremely reasonable especially considering the portions.\nParking along the nearby streets or  garages.More"}

{"review":"I was here a year ago and they were always packed, now pretty slow.  I have eaten there a couple of times this month.  Prices are up.  For example, including taxes and an add on fee for \"employee benefits\" an order of 12 chicken wings...is about 32 bucks.  Also, the quality is down.  Several of the wings I tried were good, but some were tough and gristly.  My wife spit out one wing and said it tasted \"old.\" They are cutting back on portions of things like sides, pickles, etc.  And, When I got home one night with my to go order there were no napkins, utensils, or sauces, just the food. They have always been disorganized about seating customers, and can be difficult to communicate with.  For example, they have a sign posted outside the closed front door instructing customers to wait to be seated.  I waited, in the cold and dark, but nobody came, even though I could see through window that only 20 percent of seating was occupied.  This place is showing signs of imminent failure and needs to send in a manager who can fix things quick.  Customers are responding to being nickled-and-dimed and under-served by just not coming back.More"}
{"review":"Tried the \"Pimped ramyen\" here since it both looks and sounds so fun! I love ramen anyway and it was certainly good.\nThe workers here are prompt and kind.\nVery busy environment but has its charm."}
{"review":"We're happy to hear that, Princes. Thank you!"}
{"review":"The food was good. The lychee-soju was great!!! The service was very quick. It was not very busy on a Sunday evening so our reservation was unnecessary."}
{"review":"This is a pleasant neighborhood restaurant offering good but not great food.  I have eaten here many times and enjoyed it.\n\nBut the notion that this is the 10th best restaurant in San Francisco is completely absurd and an offense to the truly great restaurants...in town.  I suspect more than a little social media manipulation is going on to pump up the rating.More"}
{"review":"This place is great! We came here a few years ago when visiting for a conference and we had a great meal overall. We tried some clam chowder, cioppino, and the crab cakes and they were all delicious. The seafood here is great and definitely...worth the wait if there's a line. We would definitely come back here again and it'll be on our itinerary every time we're visiting San Francisco!More"}
{"review":"Great spot for an outdoor light lunch.  Fast and friendly service, delicious oysters on the half shell, homemade crab cakes and a large salad to share, a treat."}
{"review":"We were in SF to see our nephew and he brought us here and picked the food. He really made all the right choices. We shared crab cakes, clam chowder,cioppino, and toasted sourdough bread. I don\u2019t know how the crab cakes stayed together, they were...all crab and crispy panko crust perfection. Clam chowder should all taste like this. The cioppino was a huge bowl of Dungeness, clams, mussels shrimp and the most amazing tomato sauce. The sauce had a nice anise\/fennel flavor and a delightful consistency. We had so much fun in this tiny charming restaurant. It is apparent that every member of the staff cares about their product. Thank you for the best meal that I have had in a long time.More"}
{"review":"Small place, waited 40 minutes for a table, no reserving ahead. We loved the crab cakes. We ordered the Anchor special for $60 with clams, prawns and oysters. It didn't all come together. Good wine."}
{"review":"I came as a walk in and was lucky enough to find a seat at the bar counter.\n\nThis place is wonderfully decorated and the staff took time to explain me their top sellers.\n\nI was recommended the scallops as a starter and then had...the famous ciopino.\n\nThe fish couldve have been cooked more on point here and some of the mussels had a not so nice flavor but the broth and crustaceans were very flavorful and the broth was exquisite.\n\nNice freshly baked bread and aioli dip too and some good nappa valley wine.\n\nWould definitely return, hands down the best scallops i have ever had.More"}
{"review":"It took me years to try this place because the wait is always LONG. Now that I've eaten here, I understand why people wait so long. First, it is teeny-tiny. Thank goodness they've been able to add parklets to increase capacity slightly. When you arrive...(and I recommend you do so EARLY), you put your name on the list and then you wait, often more than 90 minutes. I suggest you cross the street to Swirl, buy a bottle of wine, and enjoy it at Swirl while you wait. \n\nAnchor also offers a $15 corkage fee, so you can bring in any bottle of your choice.\n\nWe started with crab cakes and oysters. I tend to avoid crab cakes outside of the Eastern Seaboard, but these were sublime: lightly crispy on the outside and full of real crab on the inside. The oysters were fantastic. I tried one of several types.  Most of the food is served in large plates, so it is shareable, as was the Caesar Salad. One serving was more than enough for the three of us.\n\nWe ordered the large Cioppino, and it was HUGE. In retrospect, the small, which is also huge, would have probably served all three of us, as we ended up taking some of the Cioppino home.  The Cioppino might be the best I've had in San Francisco, which is saying something since San Francisco is the birthplace of Cioppino, and many restaurants brag about theirs.\n\nTo accompany the Cioppino, I highly recommend the garlic bread, which perfectly soaks up the tomato base.\n\nThis was a birthday dinner, and it couldn't have been a better meal!More"}
{"review":"AS A 20 YEAR MEMBER OF THE CASTRO COMMUNITY... I have had the pleasure of dinning with you to my hearts content.  Today was special, as  my partner finally agreed to meet me at your restaurant at 5 PM to wait in line for what...is normally your excellent service and hospitality.  My heart sinks as to my experience this evening.\nYou sent\nWe arrived at 5 PM together.  I had earlier been at the Hole in the Wall, where my bartender Matty and usually discus what you are serving on Sunday.  It seem that you are both of our favorite restaurant in the  Castro.  Only Matty is allow to call you in the Morning and reserve for pick-up or seating, (very hard to come by even pre-pandemic) and have his order ready at 7:30.  We discuss what is on the menu as I know you where serving red trout and when you sold that, to replace it with stuffed Sole.  Shirmp or Crab he did not know.\nYou sent\nUpon my arrival I had head phones on, I wrote my name on your board and was waiting for a seat.  Three seats were open at the bar. Your manager, whom as I should by now know his name, greeted us and told us to take a seat at the bar.  I was more specific as there was a third individual dinning alone and wanted to make sure you could accommodate him to the best comfort of the three of us.  We took our seats that he identified to us.\nYou sent\nI knew what was on the menu because I had discussed your menu with Matty and started to order.  I did not know what my partner wanted as an entree, let him order and then I order a dozen oysters, a Ceaser salad to spilt between us, and my entree.  Then I ordered a split of champagne, (for the oysters) and a split of chardonnay for the entree.  To which your maire d', the waiter who has always acknowledged our presence, offered us extra glasses of wine, if not bottles of the same wine we were dinning with on the house, refuse to serve us.  We did not confront him or cause a scene, but said I guess we will not be dinning with you tonight and left. No argument, no words, we gathered up our belonging and left.\nYou sent\nThe sad thing is that for twenty years we have always been a recongized customers.  Never over the thousands of dollars in tips and food created an issue in your restaurant.\nYou sent\nIt is funny, because while traveling through Uganda and Rowanda chasing the Mountian Gorillias, we ran into a couple from Houston.  In conversation with each other, we identified our favorite restaurant as yours.  Through the next six weeks we kept on running into the same couple in different locations in both countries.  Your restaurant made it easier for us to have a connection and say hello every time our paths crossed.\nYou sent\nThis is the memory I will keep.  Yes, you have the best restaurant in the Castro.  But restaurants in San Francisco, except yours, do not have a 60 minute waiting list at 6 PM and if they do, they take reservations.  Secondly, to have a cocktail while waiting to be seated seems to be encourage by staff to cross the street and go to the wine bar or given an estimate of the wait time, offered to have cocktails at the many other bars in your vicinity.\nYou sent\nI am offended as is obvious by this note.  I don't think you will see it and it will be business as usual.  As a person of color in the Castro, this happens much to often.  Even by persons of color.\nYou sent\nMy name is Matthew Hudson and I have been a patron of yours for twenty years.  I have supported you by lunching when I can during the pandemic.  I have  seen you with your clientele and admire you as a strong upstanding female business owner in the Castro.  But I did not deserve the treatment I received tonight and am pained as it is hard to forgive the events.\nYou sent\nSincerely,  Matthew F. Hudson,   San Francisco, CA.  94117,More"}

{"review":"We ate breakfast here while we were visiting San Francisco.  We got here early so we were able to walk right in and get a table for 4.  June was our server and she was super. She did a great job of explaining some of...the highlights on the menu. It didn't take long for them to make our food and get it to our table. I got the regular breakfast with eggs, mixed potatoes, and the curry chicken sausage. My wife got the pancakes with bananas and walnuts with the mango chicken sausage.   The breakfast was good all the way around.  The Mango Chicken sausage was better than the curry chicken sausage to me.  The pancakes and potatoes were good too!    There are a couple of big screen tv's in the dining area and we were able to watch a tennis match during breakfast.  There was 1 young lady who came to pick up our plates after we finished eating and she was rude and unfriendly and rolled her eyes at us but other than that, this place was good.  I recommend that you try this place if you are ever in San Francisco.More"}
{"review":"Great service, great atmosphere, lovely people! First stop in Sanfran fromVancouver. Highly recommend to all family and friends! Millionaires bacon absolutely delicious"}
{"review":"Outstanding pancakes. Make sure you get yours with the bananas on top. The millionaires bacon is worth the hype. Note that this restaurant review is for the Palo Alto location. Wait staff was not very attentive thus the four-star review"}
{"review":"We came here on Mother\u2019s Day (not realising it was Mother\u2019s Day as we are from the UK), so there was about a 30 minute wait to get a table here but I\u2019m so glad we waited\u2026 it was worth it!! Their menu is overwhelmingly...big, they have so much great stuff. They\u2019re such a busy place but I see why, as the food is delicious and so the staff are great too. We highly recommend the millionaires bacon, it was spectacular.More"}
{"review":"We had some delicious breakfasts in San Francisco, but my boyfriend and I both agree that Sweet Maple was our favourite. We were running short on time, and were pleased that we were seated immediately even though they were very busy. I ordered a coffee...and the Mariner French toast with caramelized banana and walnut. It was delicious! The citrus in the batter added a brightness and acidity that made the whole dish feel  lighter. My boyfriend had the Marguerite omelette and said it was very tasty as well. We also tried Millionaire\u2019s Bacon, and it did not disappoint! Thick cut bacon baked with brown sugar and spices, very delicious indeed! Atmosphere was nice, servers were friendly and attentive. A great experience at Sweet Maple! Definitely will return if I\u2019m ever back in SF.More"}

The quality of the food was first class.More"}
{"review":"Fred's looks like like an ordinary cafe from the outside, but what a local find this was! Service was excellent. And the food... huge portions and everything was fresh and delicious. Our party had a combination of breakfast and lunch, and everything came out quickly...and was cooked to perfection. We highly recommend Fred's!More"}

{"review":"It was 7:50 AM and wanted to inquire about breakfast. They were very rude. They open at 8:00 AM!!! Fred was a wonderful human that opened early for locals that worked. His cafe was crowded, boisterous, full of heart stopping delicious food and endless coffee....He\u2019s missed!More"}
{"review":"Food was fresh delicious and served promptly. Nice variety of side dishes and meat rhe sweet bacon was excellent the pancakes were really good though a bit too buttery. Fresh squeezed juice. Veggie sandwich amazing."}
{"review":"There's a reason there was a steady stream of regulars stopping in while we ate - the food is amazing and is ready quick! We got an eggs Benedict and an omelette. Both those and the hash browns tasted fantastic and had large portions. I...don't think the prices were all that bad, especially considering the Bay Area. I would absolutely stop by for breakfast again the next time I'm in the area.More"}
{"review":"I always like to search out where the locals go. Whenever we typed in Fred\u2019s, this place appeared. On TA, Yelp, FB, etc. Fred\u2019s bacon is as good as everyone says. Beautiful fruit bowl side, tasty\/crisp hash browns, great breakfast!"}
{"review":"There is a reason that Fred\u2019s is rated number one. The food and service were excellent and prices fair. The Swedish pancake was delicious, the bacon, which is well regarded is well worth the hype, and my scrambled eggs were the fluffiest eggs I have...ever eaten- as scrambled eggs or an omelette. Wow.More"}
{"review":"Food was good but not as good as expected considering the rating. In fairness, we ordered delivery, so we had already lowered expectations a little. But compared to the other breakfast places that we ordered delivery from, this was not at our top.  It was...just basic breakfast food but nothing special. I would be willing to give it a shot in person once we\u2019ve exhausted other breakfast options.More"}
{"review":"We came across Fred's on our way to family event and what a pleasant surprise.  The food was delicious with good portions and variety.  They make a potato medley of types of seasoned potatoes (yellow, purple and sweet)  yum!!\n\nWe sat outside in their court...yard which was lovely. A little bit of street noise, but minimal.  The staff were helpful and attentive without being annoying.\n\nOver this is solid breakfast spotMore"}
{"review":"my husband and I came here from the airport Nov 2019.  We were starving and boy we left stuffed.  He got the special hash ($15) and I got the marguerite($16) . Side of sausage was $5.   Both were delicious.  There were tables inside and outside."}
{"review":"great outside dining brunch choice!!! deep fried french toast!!!  athena omelette.  cute outdoor area.  they made a outdoor space with some cute painting.  street can be noisy.  table in the back corner was the best."}
{"review":"We had a leisurely lunch here comprised of a cheddar ham omelette and Denver omelette. The food was quite good and ample but the prices are high but I guess that's the cost of living in the SF area."}
{"review":"I cannot say enough about this stuffed French Toast.  It is delicious. Yummy. But I can only go here twice a year for a special treat because of the calories. The coffee I great too."}
{"review":"Service was excellent and prompt. Food was delicious. Just what I was looking for. If you don\u2019t have a reservation, plan to sit at the bar."}
{"review":"This was a great find.  It was busy the night we were there as walk-ins (no on-line booking).  There lots of locals enjoying the great food emerging from the super efficient kitchen.   The team members (including Alma) were friendly and helpful.  \nWe thoroughly enjoyed our...chicken with lemon and capers \u2014 plus kipler spuds and a medley of veges - with nice glass of Chardonnay.  Bliss.  \nOverall, we thought it was good value for money and a positive experience.More"}
{"review":"Superb authentic Italian food. We were staying in the Andrew\u2019s Hotel in which Fino is located. The linguini was excellent with decent portion sizes."}
{"review":"Probably one more of the best Italian meals. The service and food was amazing. The frutti di mare and the gnocchi were both outstanding."}
{"review":"We arrived without a booking and were taken to a fabulous table and treated extremely well. \nService was impeccable. \nWe enjoyed salads and pasta and the most amazing zabaglione and fruit. \nHighly recommended"}
{"review":"Family-friendly Italian restaurant in San Francisco. Portion sizes seemed to vary between the four entrees we ordered, but all were delicious. Salmon on the gnocchi special slightly over cooked and dry (was not asked how we wanted it, and we are used to medium-rare\/medium; this...was well done). The other seafood ordered was cooked properly, so perhaps just an \u201coops\u201d; definitely would not prevent us from returning.More"}
{"review":"We had dinner here and all of our meals were excellent - we had two of the specials (bruschetta and scallops) as well as calamari, main menu bruschetta and bread for starters.  Other mains were two pizzas and linguine  - again all were very good....Service was slick and helpful and I would highly recommend Fino.More"}
{"review":"Brilliant food and service and excellent gluten free options. Was that good eat at Finos twice in two weeks while traveling through San Francisco"}

{"review":"Recommend to come here by our hotel receptionist and wow what a night! Excellent food, excellent service, great atmosphere nothing more to be said."}
{"review":"My third time at this Italian restaurant and it is just as excellent as ever. It is a must when I visit San Francisco. The restaurant is in the St. Andrews hotel (not far from Union Square) and is intimate. The food is delicious and...authentic. Portions are large and satisfying. The staff is professional, accommodating and very friendly. I had the minestrone soup (nice chunks of veggies and a great tomato broth) and gnocchi with tomatoes and spinach. Cannot say enough good things about this place.More"}
{"review":"We absolutely loved everything about this restaurant! The food was amazing. We all had different pasta dishes and they all were fresh and delicious. The special salad was incredible and the minestrone just perfect!\nOur server was exceptional! Visit Fino you won\u2019t be disappointed!"}
{"review":"Without a doubt, one of the most enjoyable and delicious meals that I have had in a very long time! The service was beyond impeccable and the food\/wine were out of this world!  I couldn't decide between the Fettruccine Carbonara and the Piccata di Pollo...al Limone and our waiter quickly solved my dilemma by substituting a side of the pasta for the sauteed vegetables.   I promise if we weren't in better company, we would have been licking our plates!  Only one small drawn back was with our dessert.  The Zabaglione is a house specialty and very impressive as it is served up at table side, but not really to our taste compared to some others we have had.   If I have the opportunity to visit SF again, this will be on the top of my list without a doubt!  Thank you for a wonderful experience.More"}
{"review":"Absolutely the BEST Italian dinner we have ever had!  My husband and I loved our entrees but the piece de resistence was the dessert.     I have not seen this before but it was incredible - zabaglione!  Everyone of the staff were working so hard, but...we were fortunate enough to have manager Charles helping us.  He was so good, he made the meal an experience.  Thank you all for an unforgettable evening!More"}
{"review":"We dropped in on a Saturday afternoon, it was quite busy but we got seated at the bar. We ordered 2 drinks, and they were booth average, taste was not great. We continued with a antipasto platter, lots of salami meat, and some vegetables and...a burrata cheese. A 3\/6 on the starter, a bit boring. I ordered the carbonara and my wife ordered the tortellini with cheese and pesto. The carbonara had lots of bacon(prochetta) and the saltiness unfortunately dominated the dish. The tortellini was undercooked and could have used another minute in the water. The wine was our own choice and the Prosecco was ok. We dropped the dessert as we didn\u2019t feel it would make the total experience any better unfortunately. A total 2\/3 out of 6More"}
{"review":"The seafood linguine was so good! If anything it had too much seafood\u2026 if that\u2019s possible. \n\nMy husband had the Classic Cioppino and the seafood was more than abundant! \n\nIf I had a negative it would be that the wine was a bit rough\u2026 if...there was a smoother wine selection it would get 10 \u2b50\ufe0f\u2026 \n\nI would highly recommend this restaurant!More"}

{"review":"Had the whole crab - didn't regret it. I'm always cautious about seafood on holiday but they know what they're doing here - lovely and tasty home cooked food."}
{"review":"Loved that this little restaurant was casual & our table was near the door for some atmosphere...the other dining area which I saw when going to the bathroom, was a little more private. Overall it's a casual restaurant, reviews I read said locals dine there,...but the bonus for us was being near chinatown which we did not have time to explore since my hubby didn't feel well (NOT from the food). Food was great & generous portions. Would like to return to walk around the neighborhood more.More"}
{"review":"We arrived for $1 oyster happy hour 4-6.\nOff to a good start, all our meals were so good, in fact it has been a long time since our meals have been this good.\nNot so fine dining suited us, betty and her son were...so welcoming, its a pity we are permanently on the other side of the world. Highly recommend.More"}
{"review":"We had an excellent dinner at Betty Lou's. The food was very delicious, the drinks were superb and the hostesses and servers were charming and professional. The decor is OK. It is in a convenient area of San Francisco. We highly recommend Betty Lou's and...will go back very soon.More"}
{"review":"I\u2019m in town for a conference and stumbled upon this place on a walk round town. Decided to head back for dinner and OMG. The seafood linguine is THE BEST that I have ever tasted . And I LOVE seafood linguine. It contained the biggest...shrimp and scallion I have ever seen and contained no end of seafood delights. I opted for the olive oil and garlic sauce on the advice of the waiter. He was not wrong- it was simply amazing.\n\nPs- don\u2019t be discouraged by the rather odd hostess.More"}
{"review":"The staff is wonderful and the food is outstanding.  If you're looking for an excellent Italian meal, Betty Lou's will not disappoint."}
{"review":"Good service. Food was tasty. Shared a salad and seafood linguine. Not the most amazing flavours but yummy. Nice spot for dinner and really popular."}
{"review":"I would give this place a 3.5.  Calamari appetizer was okay.  Expected better flavor but it was fresh.  The chowder was good, but they brought it out too late.  They had already served our entrees.  We were four of us and we shared the Classic...Cioppino and Mike's Wok Crab.  Both were very heavily crab-oriented.  The crab was good, but we were hoping for more of the shrimp and scallops (I think there were two scallops in the Cioppino.).  The portions looked big, but we were still a bit hungry after the meal.More"}
{"review":"I was looking for seafood in SF, and found Betty Lou's online.  I had halibut, and Italian dishes.  They were well prepared and delicious.  There were many varieties of fish to choose from.  The overall fare had an Italian direction to it.  The service was...good, and timely.  Parking is a little tough in the area, but that is not their fault.  The pricing is reasonable.More"}
{"review":"It is unexpected to find this restaurant ranked high amongst SF restaurants. It has very, very little to recommend it. The food is unacceptable (I actually threw up my food an hour later) - the three of us all got inedible food. The restaurant is...in a second rate premises with second rates tables, second rate chairs and second rate everything else. Frankly, to be avoided.More"}
{"review":"Just OK.    We have gone to  many SF restaurants over the years and just OK.  We have no plans to return"}
{"review":"Ate here on a Wednesday night. It is very small so even arriving at 5:30 we waited a bit for a table. They offer a free glass of wine to help you wait which is very kind. Folks waiting all chatted and it was very...pleasant. It seems to get a lot of folks from the neighborhood. Staff were very friendly and efficient. Fried oysters were outstanding as was the sourdough bread. Parmesan encrusted halibut was very good. The French fries were thick cut wedges, and really were not very good\u2014not particularly crisp, nor salty\u2014just very dry. Next time I\u2019ll try the rice pilaf.More"}
{"review":"Wonderful owner and staff with great service and great fish dishes that are true and tried! Not trendy but is trendsetting!"}
{"review":"Since we first started planning our trip to San Francisco, due to the very high ratings for this restaurant and the very positive vibe from Trip Advisor ratings, was excited about this restaurant.  While very good, especially my meal, the Halibut, my wife was not...thrilled by hers and so cannot rate as great.  The wine was good but expensive and I didnt finish the bottle I ordered but did offer to have the staff to share with other diners.  It was very good but not great and so can only rate as 4 out of 5More"}
{"review":"Friends have been raving about this place for years. After 32 years here in SF, I'm with my friends.\nAs one reader said it's a time warp of nostalgia. Do take the time to take it all in, even in the golden blow of the...dining room. Whether you have to wait or not they start you off with a glass of Red or White wine, your choice (and a generous pour).\nThe seating area is no large but very cozy in old fashioned booths.\nLove the simplistic menu, fresh fish and generous portions.\nStarting off with some mighty fine sour dough bread & no skimping on the butter.\nBottles of wine are also very reasonable and decent selection.\nMy friend had the salmon and house salad (with shrimp on top, no less) - $30\nI had the Petrale Soul Neuberg and the cup of chowder - $31.95.  Both were piping hot and mouth wateringly delicious. \nI couldn't believe I ate the whole thing, but it probably would have lost a bit if I had to reheat it the next day.\nWe finished with a HUGE scoop of Mitchell's Ice Cream and coffee. The coffee was not weak either.\nHad a lovely chat with our server Ruth, who was also wonderful at her job.\nSo if you are thinking about trying the place, don't wait, you won't be disappointed.\nI will be back.More"}
{"review":"We tried this restaurant while staying in the Richmond neighborhood for a few days, based on reviews and proximity to our accommodation. We were fortunate to get seated right away soon after opening in a cozy window seat. The restaurant has a cozy orange-hue warmth....I took a star off for feeling rushed. We ordered a bottle of wine, but felt rushed to drink it as service was swift, there were people waiting for tables and it was obvious they were wanting to turn tables. It's a very small (and popular!) restaurant. On reflection, we should have only ordered a glass each instead of a bottle. \n\nWe ordered a salmon and fries and salmon and veg. It comes just like that, nothing else on the plate. The bread and butter was really good and they brought us more when we were finished. The meal also came with a cup of soup.\n\nThe dessert we ordered was like an oversized chocolate cupcake which was very good, although the frosting tasted like the store-bought stuff in a tub. (Still yummy!) \n\nOne other note, the wait staff were wearing masks (Sept '22) which was great to see. \n\nIf you found this review useful, please click the thank button.More"}

We were able to get the last table.  I ordered the...grilled scallop special    All meals come with bread, soup or salad, fries or veggie. \n\nThe shrimp Louie salad was delicious.  The scallops were cooked perfectly and were delicious.   Coworker had the calamari steak.  We ended the meal with the mixed berry galette a la mode. \n\nI will definitely eat here again.More"}

A limited menu of fresh entrees is carefully prepared by talented staff, and presented by a friendly and efficient waitstaff.

{"review":"This local gem opened in 1974 and I have been visiting it since 1977--always excellent service and excellent fresh seafood items. Many locals go here which is always a great sign of quality. The owner still works the tables and trains his staff well, keeping...his cooks going for over 24 years! This is a place dedicated to quality and family. Upon entering or simply standing in the waiting line outside you are offered a full glass of white wine--complimentary. If you are in line for a long time you may even get a second glass! \nLocal quality and sourcing is exhibited here! Even the wine list, though not extensive, offers incredible pricing---a bottle of very good Napa Valley Chardonney for under $30!\nThis is a place you don't want to miss if you  love quality seafood at very fair prices and with excellent service.  The staff shirts claim Petrale Power  since 1974...we simply love this place and visit whenever we can get to the City.More"}
{"review":"After a week driving down the west coast, we spent our final day in San Francisco. My husband and I spent the day touring San Francisco with a local friend. He highly suggested Pacific Cafe. The restaurant has a vintage look and feel but not...in a bad way. Our dinners were plentiful and tasty, and the complimentary glass of wine was a hearty pour. Everyone from the servers to the owners were fantastic and very enjoyable to visit with. Marlene and the crew made the last night of our trip a highlight!More"}

Most patrons chose to sit on the sidewalk outside. Still a great experience!More"}

{"review":"My wife and I visited Liholiho after a LONG workday.  I was pleased to find an available reservation without booking a week or more in advance.  We arrived early and our table was ready.  The staff was pleasant, attentive, but not intrusive.  We shared one...appetizer, one entre, and one dessert.  Everything was superb.  Do NOT MISS the Backed Hawaii.  It was even better than the Swordfish, which I highly recommend.  The bill was a tad more than we would have liked ($90+), but we were very pleased with the overall experience.  Give 'em a try.  Also, if you plan to stroll there look at the topography.  The restaurant is definitely  UPHILL from mission street, Union square, Yerba Buena, and the Embarcadero.  Walking through many places in SF is kind of dicey these days.  So a quick uber\/lyft\/ or taxi is probably best.  We got a ride for ~$10 each way.More"}

No wonder my stomach was in such a state last night.\nOtherwise, the swordfish main was great. But will all the mains, they are made...for two! I would go for the appies, then share one main if you have a partner. But avoid the game hen. And yes, my bad for not saying anything. And no, there is no view of the water from this very \"modern\" eatery.More"}
{"review":"This is my favorite restaurant in San Francisco. I whole heartedly recommend this place to my family and friends for the delicious food and aloha vibes."}
{"review":"Asian fused with Hawaiian at this semi-hot and chic now-in-the-Mission eatery. We had Poke (very good), sashimi (good), pork rolls (sandwiches, also good), and the short ribs (tasty but super fatty). The servers were great, fast, and seemed to care*. Food was fine, but I...don't think we'd necessarily hurry back to get those flavors again.  \n\n*We paid via credit card in the app you download when you get to your table (touchless ordering, because of COVID). I'm cool with that. The server mentioned once credit card was in, be sure to not over order because it's like getting takeout through a food app -- they don't provide a bill you sign. Then I asked how we tip her and she said it will be included. OK, I thought. I assumed it was all up in the prices (which weren't extravagant at all. So I thought this was great.) But they add 25% on to the bill. 20% guaranteed tip and then 5% SF mandated tax. So, be aware. I usually tip 20% anyway but not sure I loved the 25% total I didn't expect.)More"}
{"review":"I was looking forward to dining at Liho-Liho for a long time due to its popularity. We finally booked a table and while the food was really good, it wasn\u2019t amazing in my opinion. Also service wasn\u2019t great. I feel like the waiters were not...very friendly and didn\u2019t give us much attention. For some reason, also, I got VERY sick when I got home. So it just made my whole experience worse.More"}
{"review":"From meeting our server, Caitlin, last evening, this was a very good experience. She guided us through an interesting cocktail list, and gave detailed descriptions of menu items in which we were interested. In addition, she was VERY helpful in suggesting numbers of small plates,...entr\u00e9es\/main courses for us.\nHowever, at some point, I asked her if there was any other music that was available not techno, to which she replied that it was a soundtrack. She DID manage to get the volume diminished, and--for a time, perhaps 15 minutes?--something not quite as annoying in its repetitiveness. \nJust FYI as it might affect your dining experience.More"}
{"review":"After a few months of trying to figure out how to get a reasonable reservation time on a weekend I got up at midnight when they open the reservations a month ahead of time and booked a table for four.  I have been looking forward...to eating here for some time.  We were seated immediately and the restaurant is fun and high energy, not pretentious.  The menu has some interesting twists on standard fare.  One of us ordered the popcorn appetizer, I am not sure why, and it was just popcorn with salt and pepper to me.  The poke appetizer was really good, the fried rice with homemade spam was very good, the short ribs were good but I have had better, we all loved the fried chicken.  We shared a rice pudding dessert and I enjoyed that.  The sommelier was helpful and recommended a wonderful wine in our price range.More"}
{"review":"The ribs was extremely tender and juicy. Tasty and fresh. Service was excellent and the restaurant was neat and clean. A must place in SF"}

People were enjoying themselves and the environment was great.  We ate in the bar and service was excellent....We had tuna and corn salad, both were delicious.  The cocktail selection is creative.\n\nThis is definitely worth a visit.More"}

You...go in and you can just sense the relaxes and joyful atmosphere.\nWe ordered a plethora of small dishes to share and some drinks. \nWe highly recommend the shaved pig head, the kung pao sweetbread,  the curried manila clams, and the baked Hawaii!More"}
{"review":"We got a reservation when they opened at 5p. All the tables filled up within minutes. It's a must try if you're visiting San Francisco! The food is so innovative and delicious. Wonderful attentive service as well. We shared several of the small plates. Highly...recommend the tuna poke, yellowtail sashimi and the soft shell crab katsu. We didn't love the browkaw avocado but appreciated the beautiful presentation of it and all the dishes. It's pricey but worth the different tastes exploding in your mouth. We'll certainly be visiting again.More"}
{"review":"An impossible place to get into, Liholiho offers a little Hawaiian flare on the side streets of San Fran.  The service was really laid back but attentive.  It's a higher priced restaurant but the service didn't nor the ambience made me feel like it was...the typical high priced restaurant.\n\nMy quick down and dirty feedback is:\n- Popcorn - app that was good and nicely seasoned\n- Soft Shell Crap - with soy, ginger and pineapple - recommended\n- Brokaw Avocado - fried green beans and avocado - good\n- Kimchi Fried Rice - best thing on the menu!\n- Opah - a fish that seems alot like tuna.  I'd never had it before but it seemed well cooked and very meaty.\n\nOverall, the food was highly salted (miso\/ teriyaki seasoning).  The service was the best thing, oh the desert was just as good.More"}
{"review":"We had the Vincent Van Dough and the MOMA pizza both were beautiful to look at, crust was magnificent, plentiful fillings, quality cheese and generous size.  The salads are huge but at $12 made with crispy lettuce and lovely toppings. Perfect!  It is so nice...to have it as our neighborhood pizza place this month.  The ingredients are beautiful quality and they don\u2019t make the pizza soggy as many places do.  The subtlety of the roast garlic was mouth watering.  Only a couple of tables inside - but they have delivery and it took about 20 minutes for pickup.  We will definitely return.More"}

{"review":"Why is it that the simple things in life can be some of the best things in life?  Frills and hype don\u2019t necessarily equal greatness. \n\nWe sure found that to be the case at \u201cZa Pizza.\u201d  Either their pizza\/people combo beckons you here or you...simply pass right on by their humble establishment.  I counted three tables and three barstools inside, two tables outside, and exactly one television. Yeah, if you\u2019re here, you\u2019re here strictly for the pizza and the people. Not a bad combo though, right?\n\nThis place just overflows with genuine local vibe, so no posers, please. Be real or be gone (my words, not theirs).\n\nOur server was super friendly and provided great advice about an adventure we are planning for later on this trip (stay tuned!).  While I was attempting to secure one of the aforementioned tables outside, he was apparently chatting it up with my wife inside.  When he met me outside he said he didn\u2019t realize the weather was so nice today and that I must have brought the nice weather with me from San Diego.  When I asked how he knew where I am from he said, \u201cYour daughter told me when I met her inside.\u201d  Yeah, I will literally NEVER live this down. \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\n\nAs much as we enjoyed his company, we planned our visit mostly \u2018cuz of the (piz)\u201dZa.\u201d  That thin crust was just so light and seemed to nearly yield a \u201ccrunch\u201d with each bite.  We don\u2019t often include pics of pizza crust, but felt compelled to do so this time. \n\nAlthough we customized our \u201cZa\u201d, they also offer a set menu of pizza by the slice options if you\u2019re in a hurry (or traveling solo).\n\nCome for the crust, stay for the people (or vice versa).

They are cool to your kids.  The place has solid atmosphere, dingy SF but charming as it gets.  Great for people watching and a chill conversation where you dont have to shout.

The ratio of sauce to cheese was...off. There definitely was not enough sauce on this slice. When reheating a slice, the staff should take special care not to burn the cheese.  The cheese was burnt! \ud83d\ude16More"}

{"review":"Went for lunch; menus very limited and poor choices. Have not visited since Covid but was my favorite for -~40 years.  Now server staff could not understand English, brought wrong calamari , of 2 sauce choices, and when tried tell them they did not get...it. They returned with some red sauce and my bill got $$ charge for this non descriptor sauce. I wanted my special scomas usual calamari. Had ask 3 times for bread. Ordered my petrali sole but it cam with no flavor, garlic etc  whipped mashed potatoes. Before they always served nice au gratin potatoes. Now lazy cheap no prep potatoes. Horrible . It seems scomas now targeting tourists who know no better to get cash flow and do not care of their quality now. Wife wanted some crab salad or such but only fried crab cakes on menus. They need new management team and should bring back someone old who knows how it was. I may try scoma SF to see if it went downhill also and is to be avoided.  This is a real pity !More"}

{"review":"We have been here five times so I am comfortable saying, sadly, that this time will be our last. First, the lunch menu really isn\u2019t a lunch menu. Heavier dishes with dinner prices. No crab sandwich. No lobster roll. We had the calamari and it...was a greasy mess. We got bread, which was delicious, but our bread plates were bussed while we still had bread in our hands. The linguini in the seafood pasta was ridiculously overcooked, and while the prawns were very large they only took off about half the shell so you had to dig with your fingers to get the rest of the tail shell off. The sauce was average, and no freshly grated cheese was offered. My husband would have liked a second beer but our server never came back to check on us. The worst was when we saw a person plate bread using his bare hands. He just reached in and plopped three pieces on the plate. This is the same person who had just bussed our used dishes and utensils, as well as those from a couple other tables, but did not wash his hands before touching the bread or use tongs or gloves.  For someone who is immune compromised following a stem cell transplant in January, this was scary. In the end, two beers, a pasta dish and short ribs came to $114. For lunch.More"}

We were standing chatting for quite a while after they called our name, although when we realised our mistake they quickly fitted us in to an inside table (there are outside tables on the street, too). The Burmese food is excellent, and unlike anything else I have tasted - a fusion between Thai and Indian, with it's own unique twist.

We sat in the temporary outdoor section; tables were well-spaced and COVID precautions were taken very seriously.  We arrived at opening time, so...we did not experience the lines that others have described here.  \n\nI have no idea what all the hype is about regarding this place.  The food was, overall, unexceptional; of course, some dishes were better than others.  We started with an order of vegetarian samusas with house special red sauce.  The samusas themselves were quite tasty, but not noticeably better than those sold at Trader Joe's.  The red sauce was also good.\n\nMy spouse had a combo of platha and curry and fiery chicken with vegetables and jasmine rice.  The platha bread was crisp and delicious, much like Chinese scallion pancake but without the scallions.  The dip was not at all appealing.  His chicken was much better than my main; the white meat was tender and fairly juicy, and the vegetables and sauce were enjoyable.\n\nI had a combination of their \"famous\" tea leaf salad and garlic chili shrimp with coconut rice.  I wasn't impressed with the salad, which was mediocre as well as a bit soggy. I didn't like the shrimp entree at all.  The flavors in the sauce were off-putting, and the dish was not very exciting overall.\n\nService was pleasant and the restaurant was very popular, but I guess it just wasn't my cup (or salad) of tea.More"}

We asked for the milk and sweetener to be moved off the table, as the table was quite small and none of us drink coffee. The waitress looked at us like we had just insulted us. \n\nMy wife and sons food arrived. Placed down but no comment on enjoy or anything. We waited for my food. This arrived a few minutes later. Literally dumped down in front of me, again no comment. No one asked if the food was good or everything OK. No offer of any more drinks, only refills on coffee drinkers. \n\nAfter we finished my wife and son decided to use the restroom and I was considering to get another drink. But before I had the chance the bill was dumped in front of me. \n\nWhile waiting for my wife and son had returned I was how to pay. \n\nLet's be honest the food was good, but the service  needs work.More"}

The one thing that stands out, outside of the food being amazing, was that all the  staff we...dealt with were always smiling and pleasant. \n\nThe first time we ate there, is was early on a Monday morning and we were told that all of the seats inside were taken but we could sit at one of the tables outside in front of the restaurant. We were waited on immediately and quickly served. My wife had fruit and yogurt while I had a ham and cheese omelette. The fruit was fresh and bright and delicious and I have to say, this was one of the best omelets I've had in a long time. We were supposed to go on an excursion tour and was worried when we sat down that we would have to rush. However, the food came quickly and was was delicious with time to spare. We came back later in the week and got to sit inside and experienced\nthe same quality of food and service.More"}

{"review":"Breakfast here was expensive and just ok. Service was quick and attentive so they could turn the tables quickly but the food average at best. The eggs were overdone and the crispy hash browns were about 1\/4\u201d think and had the texture of cardboard. My...husband\u2019s parting words to me were, \u201cTake a good look\u2026\u201dMore"}

I ended up with the Danish meatball plate and my friend got the egg benedict with smoked...salmon. Both were delicious. The coffee was really good also.More"}
{"review":"We stopped here for lunch in the Mill Valley area. It appears to be in a community living setting, but we were welcome here. My wife had the salmon, and I had the turkey burger.

They have a great menu, with lots of breakfast and lunch options. We had a...couple people in our party who are gluten-free, and they were able to find items on the menu they could enjoy. The food was delicious and served in large portions. The service was fast and friendly. It was a great stop.More"}
{"review":"Great spot for breakfast in Sausalito. Old school diner but with some outdoor tables as well. I had Jose's Mexican scrable and it was terrific. Everything tasted fresh and was really flavorful. Open until the mid afternoon and nice that they serve breakfast into the...early afternoon for those having a relaxed start to the day.More"}

First-class swordfish carpaccio (never had it, had to try it), overcooked\/\"crusty\" porcini-topped lasagna special not great, braised lamb shank special -- outstanding and had to...take half of it home for lunch.  Perfectly cooked, could have been seasoned more, but an excellent cut of meat.  Would return.More"}
{"review":"Stopped in after playing at the pinball museum.  No reservation, quite crowded but they were able to seat us at a lounge table. Waiter was terrific and very accommodating. Started with the burrata which was very creamy, but menu indicated came with prosciutto but we...couldn\u2019t find any. Daughter likes plain gnocchi and he had it made for her with just Alfredo sauce.  I had lamb shank that was huge , tender and accompanied by a very rich polenta. Two great entrees. Wife had the pork chop which was way overdone and very dry. Should have commented earlier but didn\u2019t until end of meal to bus boy who maybe didn\u2019t understand us but he couldn\u2019t have cared less. Just wasn\u2019t worth making a fuss over.

{"review":"Excellent food and service. Margarita pizza tasted great. Could have been a little less wet in the middle. Calamari also pretty darn good. I love their marinara sauce. The server kept hot bread on my table. Bottomless diet Coke. All in all a good dining...experience.More"}
{"review":"Restaurant looks nice. The food is good. However, the woman at the reception desk   is a bit rude. (She probably serves as their maitre d'; some people told me she is one of the owners).

{"review":"We fly into Oakland, CA airport several times a year.  If time allows we dine at Trabocco each time.  Luckily we arrived in the dinner hour last night\u2014-on a Friday.  One of the Friday night specials is Porchetta!  It is absolutely fabulous, succulent and delicious....Also love the ox tail ravioli and the rib eye!  Love the ambiance at Trabocco.  Love the staff, very knowledgeable, accommodating, efficient and friendly. Make reservations!More"}
{"review":"Really excellent food. Nice decor. Friendly service. A menu with something for everyone. I drove 3 hours to go there and it was worth it."}
{"review":"We travel to Alameda to visit family, and it seems every trip includes a dinner here. And we are so glad to dine here! Sunday, 8\/20, we had a reservation. Seated immediately, instant water service, followed by attentive Nikko. We'd eaten very well this weekend,...and Sunday was a travel day, so no appetizers. Entrees ordered; a lovely bottle of wine was ordered and opened to accompany the diverse entrees. 1 Gluten free pasta with ragu (apparently the hosts \"go-to dish\") ; 2 orders ravioli with butternut squash and sage butter - the \"go-to\" for my vegetarian; and I had a truly fabulous brodetto - an octopus and tomato flavored broth with LOTS of delicious, perfectly cooked seafood. When queried, Nikko had said  this dish had more seafood than the spaghetti with seafood, and I'm delighted I followed his suggestion.\nChef and owner was present (as it seems he always is) and made rounds thru the dining room and bar. \nI'm not a fan of sitting outside in the tent enclosure, but for food this good - I almost \nwould sit anywhere. This restaurant has always excelled, and never disappointed.More"}
{"review":"I had dinner here with friends on Tuesday night, and it was so delicious that my husband took me back the next day for a wonderful birthday lunch. The owner\/chef even helped sing happy birthday! The food was as special as the experience. We started...with a fresh chilled carpaccio which was perfect. For mains I chose the char grilled seafood (scallops, prawns and calamari) and my husband had the slow cooked lamb shank. We could not fault either dish. My dessert was the house tiramisu and it was light and flavorful. Love the atmosphere here too!More"}
{"review":"When we approached this restaurant in a suburban shopping center I did not expect to come away with a dining experience. However when we saw the menu we knew we were not in for a normal Italian restaurant dinner. I had the lamb shank special...and my wife the salmon. Both were superb. In addition the prices were reasonable. I promise the next time we return to Oakland to visit the kids we will definitely eat there again.More"}
{"review":"Service was great.  Though staff had to change mid-meal, seamless with a dash of humor.\n\nPolipo e Patate (octopus) was grilled perfectly, and the onions, peppers, and potatoes tossed with the octopus lit up my mouth.  Very flavorful, without being a salt bomb.\n\nLoved the...piatto del trabocco, or mixed seafood on a bed of spinach.  Grilled scallops, shrimp, and calamari over the sauteed spinach, with arugula, cannellini beans, and grilled tomatoes. The grilled, toasted bread added a nice touch.\n\nProsecco by the glass, and a good selection of amari.  Reasonable prices.More"}
{"review":"This is not a review about the food because we never got any since we were denied service.  We had a reservation for 5 at 11:30 am today.  My daughter has a Diabetic Alert Dog and we were denied service because her service animal is...a pit bull.  We tried to explain to Christine, the owner, that the Americans with Disabilities Act does not have any breed restrictions for service dogs.  She continued to tell is that pit bulls are vicious and banned animals.  Mind you, he was sitting quietly, maintaining eye contact with my daughter and waiting for instructions.  She said they are banned from apartments but had nothing to say when I told her that those restrictions cannot apply to trained service animals but still refused to serve us. I emailed after our encounter and she said she stands by her decision and wrongfully claimed that our service animal was not neutered which has no bearing on his ability to be a service animal and was 100% inaccurate as he is neutered.  She continues to maintain that he is dangerous with nothing to base that on other than the face that he is a pit bull which is 100% illegal.More"}
{"review":"Duplicate TripAdvisor business. This is the same business that is listed as Trabocco kitchen & cocktails. \n\nExcellent food and service. Good portion sizes.

{"review":"Not as great as our visit several years ago.  \nCovid caused them to close all indoor seating and they hadn\u2019t reopened even though allowed.  All seating was outside on the parklet (patio). It was a nice day so no problem.\nI started with a Lagunitas...IPA $6.50 and my wife had an Agave Margarita $11.\nFor food, I had a Bibimbap Korean Poke $19.50, good but unremarkable.  My wife had the Two Taco Platter $18, also good but too much for her to eat.\nHalf way through, we learned from the next table that it was half price wine day and it was allowed to take the unfinished bottle.  $38 bottle for $19.   Our server had failed to tell us about this special.  A rating star lost for that lack of service.More"}
{"review":"I would rate this a 3.5.  This is mainly a take-out place with some seating outside.  There are lines here, so go early.  They do not take reservations.  The food was good, not great, and it was pricey.  We had the salmon chowder, which was...a bit too watery to be considered a chowder.  The striped sea bass was fresh and tasty.  The sticky ribs were fine, but nothing too special.  Overall, there are better seafood places in the city.  Good ice cream place across the street.More"}
{"review":"I was looking for a fresh seafood place near Lombard. Found this gem of a place! Love the offerings - i didnt know what to get first! I tried their sea bass ceviche served with chips (LOVE) and their grilled salmon plate. I can't wait...to try their other offerings. Highly recommended. Quick and efficient crew, too!More"}
{"review":"We had a few appetizers, their salmon chowder, ceviche, fish and chips and poke and everything was delicious!"}

For the area, I would say the prices are pretty fair and the portions are excellent.  This location is within walking distance from several other attractions."}
{"review":"Great seafood tacos. The Guajillo shrimp was excellent. Very well seasoned. The Baja fish also pretty good. Black bean and a salad both decent side dishes. Prices are okay as I felt the portions was large."}
{"review":"This was the most creative, seafood meal we have ever ordered. It was delicious and unique and you should go to this restaurant. We went for a late lunch and we dined outside. We started with the fried calamari. It was perfectly fried and included...paper thing, breaded slices of lemon and Fresno peppers that added a totally different flavor to the calamari. My husband had the striped sea bass with Asian chimichurri sauce, kimchi fried rice, and turmeric baked cauliflower. Such unique, delicious flavors. I had the fish and chips which was unlike any I have had before. We finished with dessert; dulce de leche spring rolls with house made vanilla ice cream and a caramel drizzle. Truly an amazing meal. Go here.More"}
{"review":"Great fresh fish! It's actually a very large restaurant right across the street from Golden Gate park and they even have a tiny parking lot for themselves. The menu is fairly diverse, but I'd recommend the fresh fish entree with crab mashed potatoes or the...chirashi, with a huge amount of rice. I cant remember the name of the roll we had as an appetizer, but it featured salmon tempura which was also great. The service was fine, but the waitress felt aloof and didnt really want to be there.More"}
{"review":"My husband and I stayed in the Marina District of San Francisco in September. I had been looking online for some restaurants to try in that area and came across Pacific Catch. We had a nice meal there one weekday evening. We both made our...dinner choices from the section of the menu in which we chose what style we wanted our dinner prepared. I chose to have Hawaiian Sea Salt sea bass with a side of Mexican elote corn. My meal was delicious! I could easily have eaten another serving of the corn. My husband also enjoyed his meal of Pescado Asado salmon. We had drinks with our meal as well, which were a bit pricey but delicious. All in all, a very nice meal with good service and delicious food.More"}
{"review":"Excellent food with prices that were very reasonable! Good service by well trained staff - you need to read the background on this restaurant to appreciate the staff!

Was swimming in gooey cheese to the point the whole sandwich slid apart. And was quite flavorless.\nGuests had Salmon Caesar (no comment) and Ribs and BBQ Chicken (no comment).\nWe all had dessert.\nKey Lime pie now just a wedge, half the size it used to be and no lime taste, boring.\nOne Ginger Cake which was HUGE and came with a side of whip cream. Very good and gingery.\nI had the butterscotch putting which was awful. It was \"pure vanilla\". When I mentioned this to the server, I was told about the pastry chef switch. I was not given a refund, but offered something else. I declined but should have taken a \"Ginger Cake\" to go.\n\nMimi Silbert needs to \"revisit\" the kitchen  as I'm sure she would not be happy about the quality of food that is currently coming out of the kitchen.More"}

Yes the place and menu is not the fanciest but we got very homely well cooked food that was excellent value for money in this location.  However, what made the visit for us...was the story.

{"review":"Yesterday my partner and I were in the City on our way to a performance of Hat Matters without a solid dinner plan. And suddenly, we found ourselves in front of Delancy Street. Both of us had been wanting to try it forever; no debate,...this was our dinner spot for the evening.\n\nWe opted to sit on the patio with a beautiful view of the Bay Bridge and the boats and ships passing us by. As it was the patio and SF's weather is notoriously unpredictable, we hesitated just a moment about our patio choice. The staff offered to seat us inside, or if we weren't sure, we could try outside, and they would happily move us indoors if it proved too chilly..it did not! No surely waitstaff here; they bent over backward to accommodate us. Turned out the weather was lovely.\n\nFor us, we were very impressed with the man who greeted and sat us (I did not catch his name) as well as both of the young men on the waitstaff who served us that are part of Delancey's incredibly successful rehab program.\n\nBoth Ruben and Randy were very attentive and earnest in their work and had a great attitude. When we asked them about their favorite dishes, they shared that they had only begun working in the restaurant recently and had not yet earned money to buy the meals that the restaurant serves (which starts when you have 18 months sober in the program, Ruben will be there on 8\/25..go Ruben!  and Randy in about 7 months) \n\nWork ethic is a big deal at Delancy Street and likely a strong contributing factor to the longevity of the program and the restaurant (as well as their catering and moving businesses).\n\nFor us, the staff was part of what made it a great experience, but we came in knowing the history and the success of changing lives Delancy is known for.\n\nA bonus for us was we ordered an appetizer, two entrees (do not miss the blackened meatloaf or the house-made ginger beer or anything on the dessert menu!)4 drinks, and 2 deserts and paid $70, all while sitting and watching the boats go by under the Bay Bridge. Also, the other customers seemed to be in on the positive atmosphere and were a pleasant addition to the already lovely atmosphere.\n\nWe enjoyed it so much we are planning our next family birthday outing there!\n\nWe left feeling very full and very fortunate it was a great beginning to a great night out in the City.More"}

We even had dessert, a chocolate beignet & an apple beignet. The food...was amazing!!\nUnfortunately, the restaurant is located in a seedy area of San Francisco (Tenderloin section) and we were worried about possible vandalism to our rental car.More"}
{"review":"We went for dinner and shared the Spicy Pasta Orleans.  It was absolutely delicious.  We also shared the corn succotash.  It was very good, but honestly the portion of the Spicy Pasta was so generous, we really didn\u2019t need it.  But we had to end...with the beignets, which were satisfying and delicious.  Brenda\u2019s is in a little bit of a sketchy neighborhood.  Either take Uber or enter from Market and go up Polk.  Don\u2019t arrive by Eddy, which is downright scary in parts.More"}

It comes out really fast and it\u2019s fresh and the service was five star. We had a little bit of everything between...the three of us and enjoyed all of it. The homemade pies are to die for I can\u2019t say enough good about everything at this restaurant.More"}
{"review":"This is a fun restaurant. We came for dinner before a show at the Orpheum. Food was good - shrimp and grits was very flavorful and delicious. Beignets are not as light and fluffy as others. Red beans and rice lacked spices. Fried chicken was...solid. Bummer that our server charged us for an item we hadn\u2019t ordered and we didn\u2019t catch it because we were running late for the show.More"}
{"review":"So good that we went here 2x in our short trip to San Francisco.  We started by searching for a place for breakfast and Brenda\u2019s seemed interesting.  Had 2 dishes and both were fabulous.  Grits with pork belly was a treat with the onion jam...spicing up the dish a bit with wonderful results.  Second meal was eggs benedict with fried chicken which tasted great.  Only minor challenge is location as this is in the middle of a \u201chomeless\u201d zone but very well worth the trip.More"}
{"review":"My family and I went to Brenda's for a late breakfast in early July. We made reservations but we must have hit the sweet spot between breakfast and brunch, because the restaurant wasn't busy when we arrived. (It filled up quickly while we were there,...though!)  Brenda's comes as advertised - well-prepared Southern food in large portions. Nothing we had was truly outstanding (it's comfort food - not haute cuisine) but everything was really good. The beignets are massive and served hot. We took a couple away with us and they were nowhere near as good a day later - so my recommendation is to eat them when you get them. But DO get them! Service was very good, provided by an ensemble cast (never seemed to be the same guy twice). Make reservations if you don't want to be disappointed.More"}

You get to chat it up with your neighbor if you want!...Be prepared to wait. First time I came the wait was about 40 minutes. The last time I visited it was fast, but it was 12pm on a Friday. Saturdays and Sundays are much busier.\n\nI had visited a few times before, and each time I\u2019d get the crawfish beignets. They\u2019re so good, I literally dreamt of them. I\u2019m not kidding. It got so bad that I had to fly from vegas to San Fransisco JUST for those beignets. And I\u2019d do it again!

{"review":"Southern spot with brunch options in the Tenderloin. Street parking. You put your name on the board inside on the right hand side and you can get a sense of your wait time. Indoor seating only. We came around 11:30am on a Saturday and for...our party of 3, we waited about 25 minutes. Credit cards accepted. \n\nThe prices are very reasonable and the portions are sizeable. I got the fried chicken basket which came with two pieces and a biscuit. We ordered a trio of beignets, which came with a of original, chocolate, and apple one. The chocolate one was my favorite - they used Ghirardelli which was super rich. The dough was thicker than I would\u2019ve liked but the beignets did come fresh\/hot from the fryer, so they were still yummy. The hot chili jelly was a good complement for both the chicken and the biscuit.More"}

However, the selections are not predetermined, as they are on a tasting menu. My husband and I like the flexibility....His quail in my horseradish, encrusted salmon were both excellent choices. We also enjoyed four cheeses from the abundant cheese selection tray. We\u2019d love to come here every time we are in San Francisco.More"}
{"review":"Hello there,\nSo, where do we begin? Here's something interesting to discuss. I recently had the opportunity to call this restaurant, and it truly paid off. I was dying to try their food for a while. Finally, I decided to arrange a party there. Even...how they treat their customers via phone made me sure that the experience with this restaurant will be worth any cost or sacrifice. The staff was incredibly friendly and showed up true interest in all my requests. This place will be one of the tops in my list of go-to places in town. Also, you gotta consider, that it\u2019s a high-end restaurant, so you can doll yourself up and enjoy a gourmet meal. I am looking forward to saying to my friends, \u00abThis\u2019s a great place. I've been there!\u00bbMore"}
{"review":"Absolutely beautiful food and exemplary service\u2026. One of the most expensive meals we\u2019ve done. Over \u00a3500 for 2. We\u2019d completed our 3 course meal in under an hour and half and felt like we were on a gold plated conveyer belt. It was certainly a...memorable culinary experience but felt curiously short changed.More"}

{"review":"Dining at Gary Danko in San Francisco was a culinary adventure that celebrated the art of fine dining and personalized service. The restaurant\u2019s intimate and elegant ambiance set the stage for a memorable meal. The menu was a symphony of flavors and textures, showcasing Chef...Gary Danko\u2019s culinary creativity. The tasting menu was a journey into seasonal ingredients and gourmet techniques. The staff\u2019s knowledge of the menu and their passion for culinary excellence added to the overall delight. Gary Danko is not just a restaurant; it\u2019s a tribute to the artistry of fine dining and a must-visit for anyone seeking an exceptional gastronomic experience in San Francisco.More"}
{"review":"my husband and i were in California on our honeymoon and part of our trip was in SF.  as we enjoy fine dining we decided to book Gary Danko, plus it's only a few mins walk from our hotel. \n\nfrom the moment we arrived to...the moment we left the evening was perfect!    we were given a warm welcome on arrival and shown to our table.   \n\nmenus given and greeted by one of the waiting staff.    drinks order taken and we were given time to look through the menu choices\n\nwe opted for the tasting menu and were permitted to tweak one or two of the courses which was great. \n\neach course was amazing!   tasted amazing and beautifully presented\n\nall through the evening, the staff who looked after us were friendly, chatty but also professional. \n\nat the end of the evening as were there for a special occasion we were given a goody bag with all sorts of treats and Gary Danko items.   which was very kind of them. \n\nOverall a perfect evening and if we're in SF again, we'd certainly return!  thank you to all the team!More"}
{"review":"I booked a few months in advance to celebrate our 25th wedding anniversary and Gary Danko cancelled my reservation via open table 24 hours before the reservation.  When I called the restaurant, they informed me that they had to cancel since all of their kitchen...staff wasn\u2019t coming in.  How is this possible at a Michelin star restaurant? How come they didn\u2019t know about this sooner so I could have made other arrangements.  I believe the restaurant lied to their customers to accommodate some private dinner due to the Salesforce conference taking place. Gary Danko doesn\u2019t care about its customers and we will ensure all our friends never frequent the place again!More"}
{"review":"I treated my husband to a special 55th birthday dinner here at Gary Danko. I was here for a work dinner well over 20 years ago and remembered it being quite lovely. It absolutely is lovely and the service is impeccable. The food is perhaps...a bit conservative, but it is beautifully executed and we felt for a fine dining experience we got a really good deal for the money.  I would really emphasize how outstanding the service is. The staff are incredibly accommodating. We did the five course tasting menu and they let me substitute two of the courses. Most fine dining restaurants will simply not do that. I think the desserts are quite outstanding here. We had the baked Alaska and the chocolate souffl\u00e9, and they are both beautifully presented a table side.  For a special occasion, this is the place to go.More"}
{"review":"From the time you arrive, to the time you leave you notice the careful attention to detail.  The food was just excellent, choosing the tasting menu and probably expected from a Michelin rated restaurant.  Service was way beyond my expectations.  Wine was at just the...perfect temperature (with excellent wine list by the way) the sommelier and the waitress (sorry I missed your names) made my dinner just great) Omar was also very attentive to detail and making sure our evening was uneventful.  I would recommend this restaurant without reservations and would come again.  Thanks from the bottom of our hearts for the pleasant experience.More"}
{"review":"I love this restaurantThere is art in the dishes, love for ingredients, old and new flavours. Absolutely the best this city can offer in terms of goodness and culinary art."}
{"review":"Came here for dinner and reserved a private room. Service was excellent - very knowledgeable about the menu and made helpful recommendations. The food, frankly, was not worthy of a one star Michelin restaurant. The plating was not impressive. Bread and butter very plain. My...lobster bisque was outstanding. By contrast,I had lamb for the main which was fine but nothing out of the ordinary. Husband and daughter got tuna starter which was under seasoned. Desserts were awesome however. In particular the baked Alaska was outstanding. Would come back but only for a special occasion.More"}
{"review":"Once again a flawless experience. From the moment we were greeted to the final goodbye. Service is impeccable without being stuffy or highbrow. They have a very knowledgeable and friendly Sommelier who was very helpful.\nThis is not a place for the faint of heart...when the bill arrives. We were celebrating our anniversary, each had the 5 course meal, one with the wine pair, the other had a couple of glasses. With tax and tip over $700., but worth every penny!More"}
{"review":"\"I had the most incredible dining experience at Gary Danko in San Francisco. The food was simply outstanding, and the ambiance was delightful and friendly. Boris, the manager, was exceptional, and I must say that everyone who works there deserves praise\u2014it would be unfair to...single out just one name because they were all top-notch. The dishes served were like works of art, with flavors that exploded in your mouth. The presentation of each plate was impeccable. One highlight was the cheese expert who provided a fascinating lesson. Without a doubt, Gary Danko has become my favorite restaurant. I highly recommend it for a memorable culinary experience.\"More"}
{"review":"We really enjoyed our time here. Although it's a Michelin rated restaurant, it is not pretentious. The menu is divided into 5 - appetizer, fish, meat, cheese and dessert - you can pick 3, 4 or 5 courses, pick from any area of the menu....You can get two mains and dessert, for example. Everything was great and the portions are big, I got 3 courses and barely made it. The drinks are good as well, had their Black Manhattan..one is enough. The service is impeccable and part of what being a Michelin restaurant is about. Michelin has been selling their stars lately (see Miami) and it does a disservice to places like this that take it seriously.More"}
{"review":"What a lovely experience. I landed at SFO at 8.30pm, and called up to enquire if it was too late for a solo reservation (website says kitchen closes at 9.30). Rhonda was very kind and told me to come on in. What a lovely experience....Great atmosphere, fine dining but not austere. Friendly, attentive staff, and a lovely tasting menu with excellent flavours, beautifully presented, delivered with impeccable timing. I felt very much at home, and not rushed - even though I was such a late starter. Amazing glazed oysters with ostreca caviar in leek fondue etc etc. Highly recommend.More"}

{"review":"Very good oyster spot with some great salads and fries too. I am not an oyster salad and loved the fruit salad (nectarine, strawberries, burrata, beet, radish, and micro greens). Small portion but delicious. My friend loved the mussels with fries."}
{"review":"We ended up going to this place after doing the Alcatraz tour, if I could do .5 stars I would give this place a 3.5. Our waiter was not very attentive and didn\u2019t provide recommendations but we made our way. We ordered the clam chowder...(which was not that great, it was not nearly as creamy as it should be) but we also got the mussels in a creamy basil type sauce and that was awesome. You can choose to have the mussels with pasta or a side of fries; we really wanted fries so we got them but after realizing how delicious the sauce was we wished we would have gotten pasta. This place is connected to what seems to be a rather new indoor market building (which is in the ferry building) and while you\u2019ve got an ocean view it\u2019s not overhanging the water or anything. It\u2019s a nice patio but I\u2019m sure there are plenty better in San Fran.More"}
{"review":"I have to say I was a little disappointed with the food here. It was on my list of places to visit while in San Fran. The service and location were excellent, we got an outside table overlooking the Bay Bridge and staff were super...efficient. I started with some grilled oysters which were delicious but then had mussels. They were quite small and the bread that accompanied them had been drizzled with a mustard mayo which also got in the mussel liquor. It made the whole thing pretty bitter. My mum had the clam chowder which was tasty but the clans were shell on which made it awkward to eat. Probably wouldn't go back. Sorry!More"}
{"review":"I visited the restaurant, and since I went by myself, I sat at the bar and was able to see the staff in action opening an uncountable amount of oysters. I ordered the oysters  sample as well as the hot oysters, and they were just...decadent. The service was good and the price was okMore"}
{"review":"Love Hog Island Oyster- the food, people, the wide everything is great! I\u2019ve been here few times in the last 2 years and every time it has been just wonderful! So glad to see this business thrive post pandemic!"}
{"review":"A buzzing atmosphere with large oyster bar (you can generally skip the queue if you agree to sit at the bar). We found the selection of fresh oysters to be excellent and the service was good too. We noticed that their suggested tip was calculated...on the post-tax rather than pre-tax amount which was the norm everywhere else...not really an issue unless you are running up a large bill.More"}
{"review":"Very poor service; rude staff. Manager was no help either and when received complaint, She blamed the customer for being argumentative."}
{"review":"Worth the wait!!! One of our most favorite places to eat in the bay! We have been coming here for decades. Usually we grab coffee, do a walk around the farmers market, and then get in line 15-20 minutes before they open to ensure getting...the first seating and not having to wait in line for 45 to an hour most times. We managed to get all 18 of us seated and they accommodated seating us on two tables next to each other.  Oysters, clam chowder, grilled cheese are musts, and on this past Saturday they had a special Halibut. Their clam chowder is much less thick than most, but just as rich, creamy, and has tons of clams in the shell that make for the most delicious tasting  soup, their grilled cheese goes perfectly to dip with the soup and is oozing with several cheeses and perfectly crispy on the outside. Pair all of this with a great Bloody Mary or a bottle of Chardonnay, it makes the perfect lunch for a sunny Saturday in San Francisco at the ferry building.More"}
{"review":"When I lived in San Francisco, this was one of my all-time favorite neighborhood restaurants. It's cozy, the staff are super friendly and it's a genuinely unfussy, American-style Italian place that fills you up with comfort food. Came back after a long time away and...nothing has changed. It's still warm and inviting with just the right mix of boisterous and quaintness. Their pasta dishes are pretty generous and well-priced.More"}
{"review":"After a 16 day tour of USA, this was remembered as the best restaurant by our family. Ate here twice, good area, excellent food, especially the Tiramisu!

The meals were so good we visited 3 times in our 10 day stay. I\u2019d get there early as it fills up fast and people will wait for tables. They also do takeaway as a bonus. Well done guysMore"}

Waiting in line in the wee hours of the morning for them to open is totally worth it.\n\nAlthough small, this place generates a large crowd which I figure is attributed to the...great aura of the place, artsy decor and what I feel has a Mexican\/ Latino vibe as well as the food which is fresh, heavy portion at an affordable price range and staff who are friendly yet professional, hardworking and fast on their toes.\n\nDefinitely worth a try\u2026 you\u2019ll leave feeling refreshed to complete the rest of your day\u2026 thank you Pats Cafe!More"}

The bread was insane as well!\n\nOur server, Jose,  was OUTSTANDING.  In fact, he might be the best sever we've ever had.  He was so friendly and enthusiastic.  He offered suggestions about the food without being asked and he suggested an incredible bottle of wine to accompany our meal. Our wine glasses were never empty (and neither were our water glasses).

The samosa salad was unique, any of...the noodle dishes are wonderful, and since we are vegetarians we were delighted with all the great veggie options \u2014 including top quality tofu. Tip: Be sure to order some of the coconut rice. It is flavorful and goes well with any of the dishes. Another tip: You can select your spiciest level \u2014 and we picked mild and we were not disappointed.More"}

{"review":"It's only been a day or two since the Governor of California lifted many of the COBID restrictions we've lived with for lo these many months.  Infection rates are down.  Hospitalization rates are down.  Many people are vaccinated and we can see the beginning of...the end of this long, long period of isolation and separation from the restaurants we love.  But we are not entirely out of the woods yet.  Dangerous mutant variants are surging in some parts of the world.  Children under 12 are not yet eligible for vaccination and some adults haven't been vaccinated yet.  Some of those eligible are being misled by dishonest messaging.  In fact, the vaccine is safe, effective, and protective not only of those taking the vaccine but also the people around them, including children and adults who have solid medical reasons for not being vaccinated.  \n\nThis is why I am so appreciative of the efforts Burma Superstar continues to make to keep everyone safe.  Staff wear masks, tables are separated, there is both indoor and outdoor dining available.  This all means extra work on the part of the staff.  They have to trek the full length of the dining room, across the sidewalk and out onto what was once the street to serve those outdoors.  They are still managing a large volume of to-go orders and pick-ups.  And yet, the food is just as good as I remember it.  Flavorful, savory, generous and handsomely plated.  And the staff are courteous and friendly.  Thank you!More"}
{"review":"We placed our on-line order at 6:00 and requested that the food be ready for pick-up at 8:00.  I received a text at 6:30 stating that the food was being prepared, so I could tell they were way ahead of schedule.  They I received a...text at 7:00 that the food was ready for pick-up.  They obviously ignored or request and their system for an 8:00 pick-up.  When I arrived at the restaurant there were a dozen delivery people waiting for food and one server very slowly handing over bags of food from the dozen or so bags sitting on the bar.  Eventually he gave me my food, now very cold.  When I asked him why the food was ready so early at 7:00 when I asked for 8:00, he aggressively and rudely said, \"I don't know.\"  We won't be back.

{"review":"This was a shocking disappointment. And expensive!\n\nWe got three dishes delivered --green pea shoot leaves, 4 small samosas and garlic noodles. $57.85. Tax, service fee and $5 tip included in this. No delivery charge from Doordash.\n\nVery, very  little chicken in the garlic noodles....Very few garnish-like vegetables. Just a big pile of flat noodles.  We threw them out after eating some, searching for chicken.  The four samosas and the pea shoots were ok, but as the dishes averaged about 20$ each when you count the extra changes, WOW.\n\nNever again. And they are taking advantage of not being face to face with the customer. No one eating this in their restaurant would have thought this was a decent meal for the price.More"}
{"review":"I keep thinking this place will be great \u2013 I've gone both here and the one in Alameda three or four times. The food is good enough, but nothing, as my mother used to say, \"to write home about.\" Some interesting dishes, but prepared hurriedly...for the crowded environs.More"}
{"review":"Wow wow and more wows. Was recommended by a local and was absolutely blown away by the style, the food quality, the tremendous service that was genuinely friendly and professional at the same time. The trolley and tray offer style of service is executed to...perfection and every dish we tried was just brilliant. No wonder it was packed on a midweek evening and holds all the accolades it does.More"}
{"review":"Me and my boyfriend had a lovely dinner here. The dim sum style was really fun and you got to see the food before choosing to order it or not. The staff was very friendly and the service was good. Prices were reasonable. Would definitely...recommend!! Favourite meal I had while in San Francisco.More"}
{"review":"Our experience was relatively poor - and my wife would\u2019ve given it 2 stars rather than 3. \n\nGood things: the food is tasty, with a good range (of choice and price) and generally OK prices (but see below). There is also a decent, interesting wine...list. \n\nBad things: while the food is good, it\u2019s not innovative or impressive enough to warrant a Michelin star. \nFurther, the quail is marketed as \u201c2 pieces\u201d or \u201c4 pieces\u201d, but the reality is that the 2-piece portion is one breaded piece chopped into two. This struck us as a bit cheeky - particularly for ~ $25.\nWe waited an hour for the mushroom toast, which only emerged after we asked a few different servers (it not being clear who was actually responsible for our covers, which was frustrating throughout the meal). When it emerged, the toast was tepid. They offered to remake the dish but we had finished our meal and wine by that stage and didn\u2019t want to hang around for another indeterminate period of time. The alternative offer was to eat it as-is, which my wife accepted (as we were somewhat hungry) but then the plate was cleared away\u2026\nMore generally, the service was a bit smug - which didn\u2019t come across well given the various flaws in the meal and service. \n\nWe expressed our concerns, which were listened to - and the quail was removed from the bill and a dessert was brought instead of the toast. We appreciated this, but frankly we\u2019d rather that they had provided what we had asked for (and were happy to pay for) - you shouldn\u2019t have this many qualms with a Michelin-starred restaurant, so it\u2019s hard to believe that the errors were particularly unusual given how many there were. \n\nThey said a few times that they are normally \u201cbetter than this\u201d, but obviously that provides cold comfort when you\u2019re out for a celebratory meal (or indeed any meal of this price and purported calibre).More"}
{"review":"This place has it all \u2014\u00a0bold and exciting food flavors, attentive service and a unique dining experience (dim-sum style, with waiters bringing around dishes throughout the night). Great balance of vegetable and fruit-based courses, meat dishes, bread, etc. We never felt rushed or pressured \u2014\u00a0it...was just fun! They were attentive to dietary concerns as well.More"}
{"review":"This could be my favorite restaurant in SF. We were so impressed by the quality of the food, the ambiance, the cool way they served the food (mixed of ordering off the menu and dim sum carts), and getting to chat with the fellow diners...that sat near us on the bar. The service was fantastic (we had Peter officially but another young woman with a nose ring was equally awesome). \n\nSome favorite dishes were State Bird Provision, ALL of the vegetbales (asparagas, salad, peas, et al), the clams, the ricotta pancakes, and the steak-toast. Recommend the ice cream sandwiches for dessert as well. \n\nWe will be back for SURE! \n\nThanks allMore"}
{"review":"Our family of four, including two teens, really enjoyed the State Bird Provision experience. Almost everything we tasted was excellent but the standouts were consistently the vegetable dishes - crispy Brussel sprouts, beets with pistachios, silky black mushrooms served in a way we had never...tasted before. Ironically, the only dish we really felt \"meh\" about was the state bird dish itself - which was over-breaded and a bit dry. We opted for very few ordering items, preferring to catch carts as they went by, adding to the fun. The teens loved it. Sure, the place is crowded and noisy - but that is largely because the food is excellent and people are excited about the food and to share in a manner we don't see in most restaurants. We would absolutely come again.More"}
{"review":"The concept is neat but we found the food to be extremely sub par so I wouldn\u2019t say it was a great place to eat. The service was also only so so\u2026we had to ask to see a menu to see what food had not...been brought aroundMore"}
{"review":"Duck liver mousse was outstanding and the brisket dumplings were also quite good.\nSmoked trout was good as well as lamb tartare.\nThe commandables or larger plates fell apart a bit.  \nThe Quail - for which the place is named - was terrible.  Breading was...very thick and clumsy and the whole thing was tough as nails.\nI wish I had known yuba was tofu skin, my mistake, it tasted like tofu skin so there you go.\nThe steak was the one bright spot of the larger plates.\nWines were interesting and while perhaps a touch pricey for what they are, aren't unreasonable.\nOverall a bit meh.More"}
{"review":"It\u2019s all hype. For a restaurant that is always booked and almost impossible to secure a reservation, we had really high expectations. As you walk in, the open kitchen looks great but after you are seated at your table, the place has no atmosphere (felt...like a cafeteria). The food was hit or miss. We had 8 items and only liked 2 of them (the duck liver mousse and lamb dumplings were very good). Rest of it was blah - felt like trying too hard by mixing ingredients that really didn\u2019t do it for us. And there are much better places in San Francisco where you can spend $150 p\/p and have a much better meal and experience.More"}
{"review":"The food was delicious. The starters were excellent. We ordered albacore, squid and cauliflower, all was delicious. The star dish was the fried quail and the steak. \nWe enjoyed the evening\nThe noise level is high"}
{"review":"It was October 1st and we had a 5:30pm reservation at the patio. The food was actually so-so, our friend who took us there was also disappointed, you can hardly find any squid in a \"charred squid salad\" (see photo)! And the service? Our server...claimed he's the assistant general manager, he totally forgot about my husband's second glass of wine; when asked, NOT apologizing! Assistant General Manager? When he took off for his break without telling us, the person who took over briefly told us he's the manager. I guess there's no real server working here? In any case, not impressed at all with the food and the service.More"}
{"review":"Disappointed, I went to this place with huge expectations based on the good reviews it has, the reality is that the proportions are minimum, example: bird provisions (one of the best dishes) are just 2 tiny little chicken wings the price above 22 dollars and...this are not the best wings in my life for sure, ordered another dumpling with one 2 really small dumplings for another 20 bucks, total it was $50 bucks and I was not gonna be ordering more little proportions to get to a $200 check, went to another restaurant instead.More"}
{"review":"We booked this ahead figuring that you can't go wrong with a Michelin noted restaurant.  The food was good and well blended flavors but definitely not the experience we had hoped.  Our favorite of the night was the sauerkraut pancakes.  Sound weird, right?  I assure...you, this is s a must try.  This starter for us though was the highlight of the meal.  Duck dumpling and the whole game bird were well prepared but were not seasoned as well as anticipated and the sides were average.  We had several better meals on this trip from far less expectations and price.More"}
{"review":"The restaurant itself is very casual and plain. They are not currently doing the dim sum presentation, but the food on the menu is out of this world. We had quail eggs, trout and chips, lamb meatballs, and the signature quail dish. They were all...done in a unique fashion, with scrumptious flavors. Every thing is to share.More"}
{"review":"We like to hit a Michelin star restaurant on our travels and State Bird Provisions came across our attention in an article titled something like the most affordable Michelin star restaurant in America.  Lucky for us it is located in San Francisco - where we...were headed in a month's time. Then the question became, were they open? They WERE in fact open and taking reservations. FYI, as of this writing, early May, there seem to be two San Franciscos right now...the tourist one and the resident one. In the tourist one you can hear the grass grow! Not even the cable cars are running. In the resident one, like on a weeknight at State Bird Provisions, the place was full with locals having a great night out.\nOK, to the details: The buzz was casual while the service was smart and attentive by the staff. Our server was great and gave good advice on questions we asked.The food was mostly delicious! My one reservation was the overwhelming use of poppy seeds on the buckwheat pancakes! It spoiled the dish as all you could taste was the strong poppy seed flavor and the actual seeds interfered with the subtlety of the other elements. Don't let that dissuade you - the meal was worth it. Rely on your server as well help in your selections. My favorite dish? I'd have to say the brown butter cake for dessert.\naccompanying photos: the menu, the garlic fry bread, black sesame duck dumplings, the REMAINS of the April cover bird & the quail (sorry, forget a before picture as they were too good to wait to tuck into) and the brown butter cake with chocolate cinnamon mousse, strawberry and buckwheat ginger. Right?More"}
{"review":"Great fresh sushi. Delicious appetizers.  Shishitos and eggplant is unbelievably yummy.  Warm mushroom salad was pretty good but not as good as the shishitos.  Had a few rolls.  Scallop and soft shell crab.  Both excellent.  Atmosphere is fine.  Cozy space. Not on or with a...view of the water. But right off and very near prime Bridgeway St. in Sausalito.  Reasonable prices and good food and efficient service.  Can\u2019t really ask for much more.  Go..More"}
{"review":"Excellent, top quality sushi. No question one of the best sushi places in the SF area. Unfortunately quite disappointing service. We had a late reservation, but why beeing seated at a very unpleasant table, getting the impression we'd better leave. We are sushi lovers but...canceled our reservation for the next day.More"}

Lots of outdoor tables, but they were filled.  Would have been nice, but...we were walk ins.  \n\nNice staff and friendly.  I had 3 pieces of sushi and a spicy tuna roll. Spouse had a an avocado, tuna roll.More"}

{"review":"Our hotel in Sausalito (The Inn Above The Tide - see review) recommended this restaurant to us indicating that it was known to be one of the best sushi restaurants in California.  While I can't speak to that, the food was excellent.  I started off...with the Organic Awase Miso Soup with Clams and then moved on to a selection of Sushi (5 pieces and a Poke roll).  My wife, not a fish eater, had the Miyazaki Wagyu which was also superb.  Our waiter recommended an excellent Japanese whiskey for me.  I finished off with a scoop each of Black Sesame and Coconut ice cream, both very good.  Our waiter was attentive throughout the evening, offering suggestions when asked, and seemed truly knowledgeable about the menu. I'll be back the next time I am in town.More"}

I was a bit surprised by the very high rating. It was good, but didn\u2019t blow...me away. My husband struggled to find something on the menu that he loved. The staff was very kind though and made us feel special as we were celebrating an anniversary.More"}
{"review":"Stopped in for a quick lunch. We presented our covid vaccine cards and id  to get in in that all the restaurants we had been to in San Francisco wanted to see them. Instead of a thank you for being so efficient we got a...sarcastic that is more information than I need and we don't check here. We were then led to a table in full sunlight and I asked if we could have another she mumbled something about needing to check the reservation book and left. After having seated two other parties she came back and gave us another table. Mind you it was 1.00pm and closes at 2.30pm and the place was almost empty. So not so sure what the big deal was. We ordered the teriyaki chicken which was mediocre at best and I had the assorted Sushi which was a let down. The fish was roughly cut, the sushi rice was warm and it really looked as if no care was taken in preparing it. We also had some Tempura shrimp and a coke. The total bill came to just under $100 not worth it in my opinion.More"}

{"review":"I\u2019m not American so I like that you didn\u2019t have to tip. The service wasn\u2019t great though- they said they were short staffed. It took a while to flag down a server for basic things like sauce. There is a queue you can join on...yelp, but it was a bit annoying to arrive when it said to for there to be another fifteen minute wait. This is fine in principle, but when you can see multiple empty tables and you have to stand is a bit grating. The food was quite nice, I personally didn\u2019t like the pancakes but my boyfriend who is American did, so I think that\u2019s just a me thing.More"}
{"review":"So bummed about this place's attitude. Wrote to them directly from their website to offer them feedback and share our way below part experience. Would have been nice to receive a response. Clearly they feel they are above it.\n\nSome feedback I would like to...share with you from our last visit.\nHaving been to your restaurant a number of times in the past, I am quite disappointed at our experience during our visit on 11\/7\/22.\nOur food was delivered to our table cold. One of the rounds of coffee was also cold. One of the dishes had country potatoes that even the server agreed weren't right (no golden color to them, just pasty white). The server brought partially re-made dishes but the experience is not what it should have been. Eating my brunch in a \"deconstructed\" way is not what I wanted...\nAside from these issues, the fact you include the gratuity in your pricing did not allow us to adjust accordingly and reflect our discontent.\nGratuity (tipping) is a way of recognition for a job well done. From service to quality of food to atmosphere.\nOur experience was far from that.More"}

{"review":"Get to the restaurant early and ask to sit out back in the garden\/patio and enjoy the mass of red\/orange flowers on the huge trumpet vine (under heaters if it's chilly).  The food is excellent, the service is friendly and gracious, plus dishes are delivered...without long waits. (Though service is never rushed.) \n \nZazie has delicious breakfasts (especially the french toast), and wonderful salads at lunchtime. At dinner, very tasty, hot rolls are delivered to your table when you sit down. Water is served mainly on request (Drought). Menu offers vegetarian items.\n\nRecommendations: Moules and\/or Roasted Veggie plate as appetizers. Main course: the Bourride (a  gorgeous fish stew), Grilled New York Steak BECAUSE it's served with a wicked brandy-cream sauce.  NOT Le Carnard (duck) - very dry.\n\nTwo additional notes:\n1. NO TIPS; they're built in to the meal price, and they fund an impressive array of workers' benefits (the likes of which I've NEVER seen in a restaurant.) The staff also enjoys revenue-sharing.  \n2.Rakuten accounts currently get 4% money back on the price of the meal (as of 8.27.22). \n\nThere's plenty of seating: Inside the the restaurant, tho' tables are a little crowded. There's additional seating just outside the restaurant's front door, and in the \"Covid Cabanas\" that have sprung up along San Francisco sidewalks during the pandemic. \n(While seating is plentiful, parking is NOT. But it's worth hunting up a spot - even if you have to walk a bit. (Pre-meal: work up an appetite. Post: work off the calories)More"}

{"review":"The food at Zazie is average.  Nothing over the top, but it is a really trendy local spot for those of us who live nearby.  Are there much better spots in SF, ABSOLUTELY!\nYou can expect REALLY long waits for tables, and over an hour...wait on any sort of online order.  They only accept one online order for any 45 minute period.  \nPrices are high, bc a 25% tip to the server is included, even in your online order where you didn't have a server.  You can't do a thing about that.  No matter what level of customer service you receive.\n\nHERE'S THE KICKER- Mario, one of the owners, is a nightmare.  He\u2019s the guy who usually greets you at the entrance and adds your name to the list on his iPad.  Many of the reviews here discuss how rude he is and it is ABSOLUTELY THE TRUTH.  He acts like he can't be bothered with anyone, he hasn't learned the value in treating all customers with gratitude and graciousness.  When that place gets busy, he starts to melt down and treats people like dirt.  I have been a local patron for over two decades, and I'll never go back because of this guy.  I'm done with his rudeness, and his lack of customer service skills.  My family and I went above and beyond to try to support Zazie during the pandemic so they didn\u2019t fold.  They were so grateful and kind then, and I wondered if\/when that would change.  Mario has since answered that question.  \ud83d\ude44  He\u2019s gone back to being curt and ungrateful in demeanor.   The food quality, portions, ingredients, and customer service have all gone downhill.  Not worth it.More"}

{"review":"Made the big mistake of stopping to eat on our holiday to California recently at this place. We had a great 2 week holiday and ate out every day and this was by far the worst restaurant we ate at. Started off badly when the...waiter took down our drinks order wrong and then the food order. Kitchen staff arrived with an extra burger and chips which we had not ordered, they got annoyed and took it back. The original waiter stormed over and accused us of ordering which we denied. Food was ok and when the bill arrived they had charged us for the extra meal which we had ordered or eaten. We told the waiter and he said it was a mistake so he came over with a new bill. We were travelling with another family so would always pay half each on every bill. We then carefully counted out the dollars and included the service charge which was recommended (Not Compulsory!!)  We gave the money to the waiter who had taken the order and left the restaurant. Minutes later he chased us down the street accusing us of underpaying by 20 dollars - co incidently was the cost of the burger he had removed from the bill. We went back into restaurant and he counted out money which was short by 20 dollars. We KNOW for a fact we had paid correctly so he had taken out the money once we had left the restaurant!!!!! Beware of this if you ever make the mistake of going into this place. Rude and money grabbers. We had a good time in California apart from this.More"}

{"review":"Not our usual neighborhood for dinner but Nopa was suggested to us and I am thrilled that we were able to make a last minute reservation. We were seated at the bar, which worked perfectly as the bar staff, most notably Sarah, were most helpful...with recommendations  for cocktails and wine. The duck liver mouse served with roasted apricots was both smooth and flavorful. The shepherd's pie had decent size chucks of lamb. The duck breast was a generous potion that could easily be shared if having an app and ordering another side. As mentioned, we sat at the bar but there is ample inside table sitting and lots of outdoor tables. The whole place is very much open plan, even the kitchen and though they were completely full and running a large staff, the place did not seem hectic but rather calm and efficient. Highly recommended if you are in the neighborhood or willing to take the short drive away from the typical tourist spots.More"}
{"review":"We were seated in an upstairs table for 2 overlooking the active kitchen. The noise level was fine, but could be loud on the main floor.  We had an excellent cauliflower appetizer (chicories) followed by pappardelle and the special dungeness crab appetizer (huge) as  mains....Both were outstanding! Meisin provided us with great service! Completely enjoyed the meal!!!More"}

{"review":"Nopa was outstanding and our most memorable meal during our recent West Coast visit! \u00a0\n\nCelebrated my birthday here and from the moment we arrived and to the very end, had a fabulous time! \n\nWe had made dinner reservations a few weeks beforehand. \u00a0When we...arrived, we were seated upstairs, overlooking the kitchen -- the perfect location. We were in awe and loved the views -- every dish looked salivatingly-fabulous!\n\nLove the little touches and attention to details:\n\u00a0- the seamless teamwork of staff, coordinated efforts = delicious, wonderful\u00a0experience\n - \u00a0how the various staff wished me a 'happy birthday' (most other places I've been to don't even acknowledge, this was appreciated)\n\u00a0- how when they thought we were waiting too long for our main course, they brought up complimentary appetizers; though we didn't notice as we were thoroughly mesmerized and entertained by the kitchen views :)\n\u00a0- inventive twists on simple, locally sourced foods\n\nAll truly appreciated.\n\nThe food, oh so fabulous and flavorful!\u00a0 The dishes we head were delicious and of sizeable portions.\n\nThey also offer a delicious non-alcoholic drink, made with grapefruit juice, cardamom bitters, and tonic. Perfect for someone like me! :)\n\nFor appetizers, we had:\n- Fried Brussels Sprouts (this was the complimentary dish): surprised by and love the pickled quince, scrumptious!\n- Wood Baked Butter Beans: we noticed that on the West Coast, butter beans seem to be quite the popular item, so we decided to give it a try.  Happy we did, damn delicious.\n-\u00a0Smoked Trout: absolutely our fave, love the beet hummus, blood orange, and roe. Terrific bursts of flavor!\n\nMain course:\n- Braised duck leg: I love duck, this was quite good\n- Housemade pappardelle with 9-hour bolognese: yummy!\n\nAt this point, we were quite stuffed but there's always room for dessert!\n\nDessert:\n- Poppyseed donuts: we really enjoyed this, the donuts were not too sweet and it was served with their addictive apple preserves and burnt honey cream.\u00a0\n\nThe staff were attentive and very friendly and the service was excellent.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nHighly recommend.\n\nThank you to Nopa for making my birthday dinner such a truly wonderful one.\u00a0\u00a0More"}
{"review":"I am originally from Europe and a few days ago I was looking for a good restaurant to celebrate my birthday party. So I called the restaurant to ask some questions. It was an international call and it felt like I was constantly being cut...off. My gut tells me, that I\u2019m not a person who picked up an English language, so my stomach was gripped in horror to repeat some questions, but the reservationist was really nice and her patience was worth any cost and sacrifice. Thanks a lot for such an awesome attitude!More"}

Our server Constantine was very helpful and even took the time to explain the history of the...building and the decor which made the evening that much more enjoyable.  I really enjoyed the crab salad and my partner had the crudo to start.  Then we shared the scallops which were done perfectly, not overdone in the least.  And the beef was aged and delicious.  We ended the night with the special olive cake with hints of rubarb and chocolate cake which were both excellent.    This is an experience not to be missed!More"}

Chef  Nancy Oakes has been at the helm since day one.  There is no one like...her. An incredibly talented Chef with an exceptional team.  And the new updates look great!More"}
{"review":"This was an exquisite experience led by our server Timothy. This guy was a veteran, and it showed...\n\nThe hostess warmly greeted us and got us seated earlier than our reservation time. We were immediately impressed by the interior design and the perfect amount of...lighting that created a romantic ambiance. The room temperature was also spot on (many places miss this part).\n\nWe loved the pre-fix style dining, automatically choosing an app, entree, and dessert for one price. It set the tone for the pace of the experience and added an element of simplicity that we enjoyed.\n\nOf course, my wife and I selected different items from the menu so we could share. We enjoyed the Ahi Tuna Tar tar & Seared Sea Scallops. Both appetizers were full of flavor, and the scallops were seared to a perfect medium temperature. The way the Ahi Tuna was plated allowed for different flavor profiles with each bite. \n\nThe main course delivered quality and excellence. My wife selected the Halibut, and I decided on the Filet (nice little surf & turf ;-) The hef nailed the cooking of Halibut, as no one likes an overcooked filet of fish. The sauce added savory notes that paired excellently with my wife's soft red wine she chose. I enjoyed the filet (grilled perfectly medium rare) topped with various types of mushrooms. All the mushrooms were not only different flavors but also different textures. Details like this make you want to slow down and enjoy every bite with real intention.\n\nOur final course was dessert, where my wife went with the option of the cheese tray. I loved that they had that option, as my wife doesn't consume white flour or sugar except for special occasions. I settled in with the Brown Butter & Pear Tart, and it was ridiculous. The chewy texture of the tart and the creaminess of the brown butter left me feeling let down when I finished because I wanted more! \n\nOverall Timothy navigated us the entire way. I spent 15 years in the restaurant industry and am consistently disappointed when dining out. This was a home run! I've been gluten-free for 12 years, and he perfectly managed my dietary needs. \n\nIt's always nice when you get to connect with people when you're traveling, so thank you, everyone, at Boulevard, for creating a meaningful memory for my wife and me. \n\nCheers to your continued success!More"}

{"review":"On September 22, 2022 I invited my friend for her Birthday to Boulevard in San Francisco. We are from Texas and we had never been, we arrived at our reservation at 8:30 and seated by - very sweet hostess. We sat and they gave my...friend  a birthday card and we ordered a bottle of wine while we looked at dinner menu. Turns out our waiter, Dino, told us that we had to order the pre set menu in the dining room, which we were never aware of that this was mandatory.  We thought we would order a la carte, but little did we know we had to order one of the prefixed menu items each. We asked if we would just share one prefixed or a la carte and he said he would ask the manager. Jacob the GM came to our table and notified us that we had to order the prefixed menu each or we would be relocated not in the dining room area basically to the bar. We already had our bottle of wine, complimentary starter. We were mortified that we would be relocated because he didn\u2019t make an exception. He said I have a great table for you in the corner, why would we move when there were several open tables in dining area. I politely asked Jacob, If we could just stay and he rudely said no. Jacob insisted on moving us to the very dark back section of the lounge bar area.  The point of us visiting boulevard was for the ambiance and food, but Jacob made it the worse experience because he told us we had to move in front of the other customers seated next to us, we saw him whisper to his employees while they stared at us while we finished our bottle of wine, so we immediately asked for the tab and he insisted we move but we wanted to leave because he embarrassed us and was so rude beyond anything I have experienced in a restaurant. Slammed the tab on the table and we took our time finishing our bottle of wine. On our way out we thanked the nice hostess and Jacob rushed up to us to ask what was happening because we were thanking her and I accidentally bumped into him and Jacob shouted to me DON\u2019T TOUCH ME! The GM Jacob is not representing this restaurant in a positive manner. He should have had good judgement and let us stay wheee we were seated, we were willing to spend a lot , had ordered wine, it was my birthday , and there were so many vacant open tables. He was very unprofessional and rude, made us feel so much n comfortable and unwelcome. I asked our waiter Dino the name for Jacob\u2019s supervisor and he was scared and did not disclose. The worst experience in San Francisco!More"}

{"review":"Just Another Great Meal & Wines\n\nIn August, we were back in San Francisco for meetings for my wife. This has been a constant for 15 plus years, with at least once per month business trips - and sometimes more - many more. Those are...winding down, as her corporate offices are moving to Chicago, so we have been doing our \u201cswan song,\u201d of San Francisco dining, making sure to get back to our favorites, while we still can. Boulevard, at 1 Mission St, not too far from the Ferry Plaza Building and the Bay has been one of our favorites, over the years, since we first discovered it. Well, we did not actually discover it, per se, as one of my wife\u2019s San Francisco co-workers first recommended it, and we sort of filed the name away for later. Then, a year later, a friend, who is a Sommelier in San Francisco said, \u201cYou must visit Boulevard for their wines, but do stay for the food!\u201d Two recs, and we booked Boulevard for the next trip. We did go for the wines, and stayed for Chef Nancy Oakes\u2019 food. That was probably about 5 visits ago, scattered several months apart. This visit, was just under 12 months, since we had last dined there.\n\nOften, I have to meet my wife for dinner, as her meetings always seem to run over. This visit to Boulevard was an exception, and I think that it was the first time, that we walked through the door together - at least in many years. We were seated at a small table, along the windows, looking out onto Mission St, with a view of the open kitchen to my left, and to much of the main dining room. Over the years, we have ordered \u00e1 la carte, but also enjoyed Chef Oakes\u2019 Seasonal Tasting Menu, which is what we decided on this visit. While maybe not truly \u201cfarm to table,\u201d Chef Oakes mostly does local sourcing, such as the Monterey Bay Octopus on the Tasting Menu.\n\nThe wines, that were part of that initial recommendation, were still on the list. In some instances, we have turned the Sommelier loose to pair the wines, but as Boulevard has a very good half-bottle list, that was the direction I went with. As we often dine as a couple, a workable list of half-bottles will allow me to do my own pairings, without sacrificing to a B-T-G list (though Boulevard\u2019s is a good one), or having to pair just the perfect 0.750 bottle with all dishes, and especially a tasting menu.\n\nAll of the dishes were very good, plated beautifully, and in keeping with the Summer Season. Our service was perfect, and the pacing ideal - no long pauses, or rushed aspects. The wine service was excellent, and the stemware very nice. The only little complaint that I had, was that this table was small, but almost all along the exterior wall, are. I like the two \u201cbooths\u201d across the aisle from where we sat, but then one\u2019s back is to the open kitchen. This table would have been problematic, if we had gone with the Sommelier\u2019s Wine Pairing, but with just 2 glasses each, we managed fine.\n\nThe lighting is good, and we had the benefit of the early evening sky, through the windows. The noise level rose to about moderate, and especially when the little bar, toward the front of the restaurant, filled up - still, easy conversation was possible. There is seating at the front of the restaurant, but I find that with its proximity to the bar, it can get a bit loud, plus patrons entering the restaurant walk right beside your table. I prefer the area to the rear, closest to the kitchen, as it is usually quieter, and has far, far less foot traffic.\n\nI am not sure if we\u2019ll make it back, but hope to, at least once more, before all of our trips point toward Chicago, instead of San Francisco - either way, I will toast Chef Oakes and Boulevard, and also our Sommelier friend, who said to go for the wines, but stay for the food. How correct she was!More"}

{"review":"Do Not Overlook this food truck when visiting the Wharf! You will not be disappointed.\nGarlic fries are superb and \"garlicky\"."}
{"review":"Tucked away, but totally worth it. We knew it'd be good based on how busy it was for off the beaten path, and it did not disappoint. Delicious... fries\/chips were amazing, get the garlic fries!"}
{"review":"Fish & chips were yummy, especially the chips - I subbed garlic fries - YUMMY, and with real garlic! Cool concept - order at the truck, and eat on picnic tables. Quick and fairly reasonable. Great service!"}
{"review":"When we travel we try to go to new places for every meal.  But with Codmothers, when went twice.  Awesome calamari and fries.  I prefer my fish and chips and fish tacos more small pieces rather than a few larger pieces but we still enjoyed...it.  The Baja sauce was very flavorfulMore"}
{"review":"Definitely a Fun place to grab a bite to eat and close to Fisherman\u2019s Wharf!  Friendly staff and great food!"}
{"review":"A food truck selling tasty seafood.  I enjoyed the fish and chips and their calamari.  While it wasn't the best I've had, it was definitely good and the prices were very fair.  \n\nNot a lot of seating and it can get hot due to it...being outdoor seating only.\n\nI'd definitely go back.More"}
{"review":"Might be the best fish and chips I have ever had. Two big pieces of perfectly battered & fried cod that was hot, flaky and tasted amazing. \nAs good as the fish was, the fries were the star for me. Thick cut fries that stayed...firm when doused with malt vinegar. Salted perfectly. \nThe shrimp were good too but the standouts were the fish and chips. \nIf you are down in Fisherman's Wharf, skip the trendy expensive places for lunch and make this your stop!More"}
{"review":"Great fish&seafood. Clean. Quick. Tasty. Served good to go. Excellent combo options. Really good choice and will certainly come again!"}
{"review":"We like fish and chips...and eat it everywhere...but we both agreed this was the BEST fresh Cod we've ever had.  The taste was perfect...firm and delicious....batter great too...and portions very generous.  The clam chowder was so good too.  I had the combo...which came with shrimp...and they were very big and fresh as well.  Can't say enough good things about this little food truck with an enclosed and open outdoor dining area...very near to Fisherman's Wharf piers.More"}
{"review":"The flavour was very good! Served nicely and worth the wait! Super friendly service as well! Definitely worth going to! Wife had the Clam Chowder and said it was very good as well."}
{"review":"Convenient to our hotel and pier 39, GREAT tasting food at a great price point for our family.  Fish breading was light and crisp. Food was right out of the kitchen made to order.  Great service, great staff.  For a food truck it was a...great experience with just enough outdoor seating to make us want to come back at the end of our touring the city for a quick dinner on the way back to the hotel.More"}
{"review":"The chowder in a sourdough bread bowl, calamari, fish and chips, french fries with spicy dressing - all were so delicious and satisfying and generous serving."}
{"review":"Small outside eating area perfect for our family of 4 after a long day walking around SF.  The breading on the cod crispy, fresh, not oily and the different flavored fries were outstanding. We ate there  out of 4 days and would for sure again....Prices definitely reasonable, you should eat here!More"}
{"review":"My \"go to\" in SF. The Norwegian Eggs Benedict with Wasabi Hollandaise is absolutely delicious. It's SO good I usually order it every time."}
{"review":"Hello Sunshine, thank you so much for your amazing review and ongoing patronage! We're thrilled to hear that our Norwegian Eggs Benedict with Wasabi Hollandaise is your go-to dish. We can't wait to serve you again soon!"}
{"review":"I highly recommend this spot for a good basic breakfast. The coffee was the best that I have had in the area. There really isn\u2019t a good excuse for bad coffee, but so many places do not make it well. The breakfast was very good....I ordered an omelette which was cooked well and it was huge. The wait person was friendly and efficient. My only criticism is that it came with one piece of toast instead of two. The restaurant was not overly crowded which is important to me when dining inside.More"}
{"review":"Hi. Thank you so much for this kind review. We look forward to having you visit us again!"}
{"review":"We were here two times, the first time just for drip coffee to go, and the other time for a sit down breakfast.  The drip coffee was ok but not wonderful.  The sitdown breakfast, however, was very good.  We had the pimped up hash and...the forentine benedict and both had excellent flavor and were hearty breakfasts that carried us for most of the rest of the day.  Service was relatively quick it was overall a great experience.  Our server (Noi) did everything except cook and she did it without making it look difficult or like she was rushing.  The sit-down area is small so get there early if you want guaranteed seating.  We were there only a few minutes after they opened and they were half full already.More"}
{"review":"Thank you for your visits and nice review. We're pleased to know you enjoyed your meals and we look forward to serving you again soon!"}
{"review":"We were staying at the local (3 minute walk) Hotel Nikko and came here on three consecutive days-largely for the Millionaire\u2019s Bacon! The pancakes were light and fluffy and a good choice of eggs. Would recommend!"}
{"review":"This is a small restaurant with limited room and limited seating. Depending on when you arrive, you will likely have to queue although it moves fairly quickly. In part, because the chairs are singularly uncomfortable so nobody stays very long. The food selection is good,...the quality excellent and quantity very generous. That said, it\u2019s expensive for a breakfast, but at least you probably won\u2019t need lunch!More"}
{"review":"It is so nice to hear your big breakfast was excellent and filling! Jaimie, we appreciate your visit, and thank you for taking the time to share your experience with us. Please come see us again next time you need a meal to carry you...More"}
{"review":"Hidden gem!!! Get there before 9 otherwise you will wait but it is worth it!!  Food is delicious and service is great!!!  Coffee is fresh since they use whole beans so y which I  picky about my coffee lol"}
{"review":"Fantastic breakfast.  Everything is fresh and homemade.  What a hidden gem.  The food beats anything I have had at the fancy hotels."}
{"review":"Nice little coffee shop that does a good selection of food. Everything was tasty and seasoned well. I ordered breakfast tea and the water wasn\u2019t particularly hot. I also ordered the chicken sausages as a side and they were a little grizzly in places. Overall...though, it was a good place to eat and I would go back.More"}
{"review":"Extremely tasty breakfast in a nice environment. We will definitely be back next time we are in town. Restroom needs a makeover."}
{"review":"Ate here because of the rating......to say the least it was a bit overrated. Should have read the recent reviews, they more accurately reflect this restaurant.  Coffee was luke-warm and average tasting.  Saw the waitress pour water into an orange juice before serving it to...another customer.  Hot chocolate drink was a package mix stirred in hot water.   Food was OK, but not worth the price.  Maybe the Tripadvisor analytics are mixed up on this one.More"}
{"review":"I have no idea why this has the ratings it does. Food, average. Coffee terrible. My $5 hot chocolate was a Swiss Miss stirred into hot water with a plop of canned whip cream to cover up the fact that it wasn\u2019t real hot chocolate....Sitting at the first table meant I could see into the kitchen area. Saw the waitress open fridge, grab one of several pre-pored orange juice glasses. All were 3\/4 full. She pulled one out, filled the last 1\/4 with tap water, stirred quickly, and served it to the table next to ours. Just abysmal.\n\nCafe is located in such a sketchy area  that I\u2019d have turned back if my husband hadn\u2019t have been there. Dirty, garbage everywhere, scary people loitering around. Now Taylor Street itself is not all bad. We were on Taylor up in the Nob Hill area. Totally safe and clean\u2026 but this area is down in the tenderloin area. Even the hostess at our place warned us to stay away (she scribbled out that area with her pen\u2026 on a map \ud83d\ude02)\n\nThis city\u2019s restaurants automatically attach a \u201cemployee benefit \u201c charge onto your bill so if you were inclined to tip the waiter, that\u2019s just MORE money. What a mess.More"}
{"review":"I walked to the Taylor Street Coffee shop based on the high ratings on Trip Advisor. My experience there tells me something isn't quite right. The neighborhood is filthy with human waste on the sidewalks (hence watch your step in the title).\nThe coffee was...weak and just barely warm. I upgraded to the \"Millionaire bacon\", as I hadn't heard of it before. The bacon was very greasy and full of fat, I wouldn't recommend it.\nOne slice of bread for the breakfast, and a small orange wedge for a garnish. The restaurant was cold as the door was left open.\nHow this place gets the ratings it has is a mystery. Perhaps it has changed ownership recently?More"}
{"review":"I\u2019m a little confused why this has such high reviews. I\u2019m thinking maybe people just don\u2019t get much breakfast food in this area since locating a decent breakfast was tougher than I expected. However, getting to the cafe was sketchy in of itself. This appears...to be in the tenderloin district of SF and while trying to navigate there as a solo female traveler early in the morning I felt extremely unsafe. The restaurant itself looked very dirty from the outside with rotting food and garbage littered all in front of the door. I stepped over everything and braved the shady characters that were roving about the streets because google says this is one of the best breakfasts in the city. \n\nI was served coffee with a dead bug in it. The new cup of coffee was extremely weak and bland. I gave up on the beverage. The meal, while good, Was nothing out of the ordinary and certainly not much better than what a typical dennys, bob evans, etc would be. Very standard and a typical American breakfast. I hurriedly ate the breakie and then rushed back to my market area hotel room. \n\nUnless you are staying in this district I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s worth venturing to.More"}
{"review":"This was such a great find. It is tiny but the portions are huge. Everyone in our party loved their meals. We did have to separate because the space is so small and tables are limited, so be prepared!"}
{"review":"Hi Emma. We're happy you found us and that your entire group enjoyed your meals. We apologize for being so small you had to separate and we appreciate your understanding. Hopefully we'll see you back some day soon!"}
{"review":"The service was very nice considering this place was packed! Half hour wait for some very average breakfast. Hashbrowns overly salty, millionaire bacon and eggs, meh. Pancake, meh. Expensive and disappointing."}
{"review":"We traveled to San Francisco for my wife\u2019s birthday, and wanted a nice restaurant that was a little off the beaten path for a special dinner.  Several friends that know the city had recommended Milano, and we were certainly not disappointed. \n\nFirst off, the service...was perfect.  Not obtrusive, but properly attentive. We were greeted very warmly by, the hostess (more on that later), and our server helped with excellent suggestions all the way around. One of our issues I\u2019m going to a nice Italian restaurant is a finicky teenager who generally wont eat anything more interesting than pasta with olive oil and Parmesan. Our server had the kitchen make a fettuccine dish that was within her strike zone, but a little more adventurous than the crap she normally eats\u2026.  My wife had gnocchi in a tomato and basil sauce, and I had veal marsala with a side of pasta in a sausage cream sauce. All of it was tremendous. The thing that stood out the most was your fresh. Everything tasted. For us, that is what separates Milano from so many other Italian restaurants that we have visited.  The Bruschetta was a definite standout, and the wine list has some gems.  \n\nThe pacing of the dinner was perfect. Nobody hurried us, if we needed anything there was somebody right there, and it was all very pleasant and relaxing. We took our time, lingering the way you probably would over dinner in Italy. And everybody, even finicky daughter, agree that it is one of the best meals we have ever had in our travels.\n\nBut what really made the visit memorable is the way that the staff observed what was, for us, a very special occasion. It was not only my wife\u2019s birthday, but also the fifth anniversary of her being confirmed cancer-free. I mentioned that we were celebrating both items when I made the reservation.  The hostess, having been through similar struggles herself,  could not have been sweeter to my wife as they shared a really good, genuine heartfelt bonding moment.More"}
{"review":"Excellent food for a family dinner - best Italian I\u2019ve had in San Francisco. Authentic and not over the top interior. The waiter was knowledgeable about the the food and wine. The crostini appetizer was to die for, so we got two orders. I had...the gnocchi - I am not the biggest fan of gnocchi so I should\u2019ve gotten the spaghetti or tagliolini. Desserts were delicious - I had the gelato and the tiramisu was delicious. We will be back definitely.More"}
{"review":"After reading Reviews about here we booked Dinner in high expectations .\nAll I can say is that in all our journeys we have never come across more \nignorant , rude , and pure lack of decency from staff anywhere .\nFirstly to get glasses...of warm water then tasteless and totally overpriced Food .\nAll during our time here 3 different staff members took it in turns to come and stand near our table all just staring at us and not a word from anyone . \nTo be avoidedMore"}
{"review":"We dined here twice on our week long visit to San Francisco.  The service was fantastic and when we returned for a second dinner we were treated like returning family members.\nThe pasta was amazing!  We felt like we were dining in Italy with the...wonderful flavors of each dish.\nThe wine selection was superb, both Italian and California selections.\nI highly recommend this wonderful, friendly restaurant and look forward to returning on our next visit to the city.More"}
{"review":"We love Ristorante Milano. As noted in my five star selections, the ambiance, excellent service and delicious Italian food continues to offer the best experience to their patrons. We drive an hour round trip each way (and that's with easy traffic) into San Francisco from...the East Bay to enjoy dinner at this restaurant. The owner and the servers go out of their way to remember you if you are a frequent visitor, however, we were treated especially well even the first time we visited Ristorante Milano. The owner, originally from Rome, loves sharing knowledge of his home country, especially if you tell him you've either been to Italy or you are planning a trip. He recommended a restaurant in Rome (he knows one of the owners) and we went. It was a memorable experience with amazing Italian food. Every dish we've enjoyed at Ristorante Milano is fresh, served piping hot (one of my pet peeves when food is served lukewarm) and delicious. In our most recent visit, I tried the breaded sardines (I do not like sardines) with fennel and arugula. We will definitely order this appetizer again. The lasagna is yummy with fresh pasta sheets and a veal, pork and beef filling with a creamy sauce. It melts in your mouth. My husband enjoyed rigatoni with beef cheeks, which he also said was delicious and he ate every bite. Memorable tiramisu and an espresso affogato topped off the dinner. Stuffed and satisfied, even the cool wind in SF and a walk. to our car will not deter us from returning to enjoy another scrumptious dinner and visit with Aldo, Maurizio and Roberto in the future.More"}
{"review":"We have been to Italy several times and Ristorante Milano is the real deal. It is located in a quiet neighborhood and is filled with the locals.\n\nMaurizzio made us feel so welcome. The food and service were so delightful we returned once more on...our vacation. The owner , Aldo, stopped by to greet and thank us. It is family run and you can feel the pride and pleasure they take in every detail.More"}
{"review":"Grazie for the great review.! We really enjoyed having you and hope to see you again soon, Aldo"}
{"review":"A quaint and inviting spot. I felt like I was in Italy! We found a last minute reservation and are so glad we did. The food is fresh and full of flavor, service is truly spectacular, and the ambience is perfect for a date night...or a day\/night out with friends.  The waiter went out of his way to make it a very personal and welcoming evening, checking in at the perfect time every time, and pacing us with the different selections of appetizers and entrees we ordered. \nWe cannot wait to come back to SF and visit Ristorante Milano again.More"}
{"review":"We were just walking around when we cross into this restaurant at dinner time. Based on the good atmosphere from street view we decided to go in. Since we don\u00b4t have reservation (recommended in advance) we had to wait around 30 minutes, but worth it....Very warm service.\nThe Fish of the day was very tasty, the pasta was very good, the red wine recomended by the house was like in italy wine house expectations.\nIf you are staying like us in Broadway \/ Polk street and like italian food experience this restaurant shoud be in your bucket list.More"}
{"review":"Went there when they had just opened at 5 so I didn't need a reservation but I think you should have one. \n\nEvery single bite was delicious and I was so full but I had to try the dessert coz I was so tempted! \n\nBruschetta...was divine and fresh.. Chestnut ravioli\ud83e\udd24\ud83e\udd24 and the ricotta tart in the end was devoured.\n\nPortion are perfect for a normal person not the huge American portions. \n\nPerfect is an understatement!More"}
{"review":"Just a wonderful meal here to celebrate a landmark birthday. Totally unpretentious, this restaurant all out disappears into the neighborhood. THe owner and manager were warm and attentive. We will be back!"}
{"review":"It took is a long time to find an Italian restaurant and we were all happy to have found this little gem. The outside is not fancy, the inside is pretty small, but the food is delicious.\n\nThe owner is very nice and you can...tell he cares about his customers. The waiter was also friendly and felt like you knew him. They were accommodating for our token vegetarian and we all loved the food. \n\nThe home-made pasta are so different, they melt in your mouth. We tried them with meatballs, mushrooms, and putanesca. All good but my favorite was the mushrooms with tiny bits of Italian sausage. The burrata also melted in our mouths, and the veal chop was tender. We were full, but it was too delicious to not try at least a crostata (my favorite) and a tiramisu (my family said the best ever).\n\nArrive early to have a chance to find a seat, or book ahead because it's tiny.\n\nAbout information on TA, I will upload some photos because I couldn't recognize any of the ones you see. The price is more $$$ than $$.More"}

{"review":"One of my favorite Italian restaurants in the City, Ristorante Milano serves authentic northern Italian food using fresh, local ingredients. It has a very small dining room, attentive staff, and delicious food. I love their house-made pasta dishes, of which my favorite is their Linguine...ai Frutti di Mare.More"}
{"review":"I went to try it out since my sister had heard about it on \u201cCheck Please\u201d. All had raved about it and want to give it a try myself. \n\nHad a delicious dinner - crostini with mushrooms, gnocchi and finished with the ricotta crostata. All...done well and a charming spot in Russian Hill. \n\nCatch either the 12 or 10 from downtown financial district and you arrive in minutes.More"}
{"review":"This is real-deal Italy Italian, from food, to wine, to service, to decor and seating style.

{"review":"After missing breakfast at the hotel, I was looking for someplace to eat before heading to the airport. Saw a line of people waiting to get in so I decided to give it a try as there did not appear to be many options nearby....The line moved swiftly and being there on my own I chose to sit at the counter rather than taking up a table that others could have had. The menu was enticing with lots of choices for either breakfast or lunch dishes. It was 11am so I went with the breakfast of shrimp and crab cake benedict with sauteed spinach and dill sauce and you had a choice of either crispy potatoes or a salad. I opted for the potatoes which were also delicious. The flavors were incredible. The coffee was excellent and the service was fast and courteous.  Granted, the prices were higher than what I could normally pay for breakfast but the food selections were not your typical breakfasts.  I I recommend if you are in the area.More"}
{"review":"Craving a delicious breakfast, we were looking for the best that SF has to offer. In a city built for food lovers we were looking forward to a filling and tasty breakfast. After using Tripadvisor's recommendations we arrived. The restaurant was very small and crowded...with patrons almost sitting in the kitchen area. No room to move around at all. (curious what the health department says about that) \nWe however sat outside which was slightly better and thought the menu looked enticing. \nWe ordered the lemon pancakes and egg plate and the benedict. My husband, who trained in SF and is now an executive chef is very choosey when it comes to good food and this was not it! It was average at best and VERY overpriced. We had two breakfast meals and two cups of coffee. Our bill was more than $70! That price should only be commanded if the food represents that high a quality. \nThis food, the location, and the bill left us saying \"OH MY MYMY! \"We will not return.More"}

{"review":"Omg what a delicious breakfast.  Upscale in taste but no pretentious ambiance. Good neighborhood breakfast place without the usual tourists.  Good coffee and polite wait staff.  \n\nWe took the cable car and walked the last few blocks. Got a table immediately - but then we...did arrive about 10:15 on a Monday.   \n\nMenu is short but creative and inspiring.  Not the usual 2 eggs with bacon and toast and hash browns.   Wife and I shared the Peasant Lorraine omelette- came with 2 slices of sourdough toast and potatoes (with seasoning), and Banana souffl\u00e9 pancakes cakes.  So good!   \n\nCoffee was medium and frequently refilled.  Next time we\u2019re back in SF, this will be a return visit.More"}

{"review":"I rarely eat breakfast but today I decided to enjoy the gorgeous morning in SFO. I\u2019m from out of town so I did a search for breakfast places near me. Mymy had great reviews and I was looking forward to having a great breakfast. I...could not have been more disappointed.  Matter of fact breakfast is hard to mess up\u2026or so I thought. I ordered the Bala California Benedict. An expensive breakfast mistake and disappointing. The entire dish was cold. The poached eggs COLD.  The crab and shrimp COLD. The potatoes Cold.  I grabbed the attention of a waiter and stated to him my food is cold. He said to me this is a cold dish. It\u2019s served cold because it would cook the egg.  There was no attempt to fix or replace my plate of cold food. I\u2019ve eaten poached eggs many times and I\u2019ve even cooked them for myself. This is the first time I was served a cold poached egg\u2026and definitely the first time I\u2019ve heard an entire plate of food is served cold because it would cook the egg. Have to say this, what seems to be a popular place, is the worst breakfast I\u2019ve ever eaten. Not just because it was cold, but also it should have been a few layers of flavours but actually was flat. \n\nIf this is a cold dish it sh;Ulf state it on the menu. I think most people, like myself, have an expectation a benedict dish is warm.More"}

The wait was unbelievable and I was required to wait...in a line that was skipped by some patrons. Once the food arrived, our order was incorrect and the waiter asked if he could just \u201cput it on the side\u201d instead of fixing\/re-preparing the order after our extremely long wait. I told him no and that I wanted it done correctly. \n\nNot worth the wait or money.More"}

The Pho was excellent, the French toast was perfect, and the omelets are made to order. I...loved this place and can't wait to go back. This is our new breakfast spot when we're staying in the bay.More"}
{"review":"Really good solid reliable breakfast.   Traditional diner breakfast choices.  Good coffee and the food was filling.  We went Sunday AM at 9, and there was no wait.  Really nice staff; family run. Good customer service. Coffee refills were frequent. We shared the veggie omelette- plenty...of food for 2 middle aged travelers.  Forgot to take pics- but our food and the ambience matched other people\u2019s.More"}
{"review":"We had breakfast here one morning and the service and food was excellent. Would highly recommend as  good value for money."}
{"review":"We were staying in a nearby hotel on a room only basis, hence needing a good breakfast to start the day.  We followed the TripAdvisor recommendation and tried Darren\u2019s Cafe.  A good decision and ate there for four mornings.  On each occasion, the staff were...welcoming and attentive. The food was great as was the coffee. A good start.  The costs in San Francisco would generally make you teeth melt however the bills here were reasonable - about $45 dollars for two breakfasts and coffee.  Top tip for this place is get there early, as there can be queues.More"}
{"review":"We dined here three times during our SF stay....and probably would have eaten here more, but we thought that we should \"expand our horizons\".\n\nWe tried so many breakfast dishes here.....French Toast, Pancakes, Omelettes, Corned Beef & Eggs, English Muffin Sandwiches.........all were great-tasting and served...very promptly!\n\nThe staff was always pleasant and the prices were VERY fair, considering SF costs.\n\nIf you're staying at a hotel close to Fisherman's Wharf, this is a place you most definitely need to visit for breakfast.More"}

{"review":"Second time here in a couple months.\nFirst time for brunch, this time for dinner.\nSeating is on a first come, first serve basis and they fill up quickly after opening. We were seated outside as our guest was running late. But the heaters outside...are very powerful, so we were fine outside.\nThe hostess Mary is the Bomb! Very attentive to our needs and even provided chairs for us to sit in while we waited for our guest. She did her best to hold a table for us inside, but the line dictated she had to give the table up. It was cool though.\nService is steady and thoughtful. Always checking on us, but not overly so.\nDecent wine choices, my how the \"bottle price\" has gone through the roof $50. But it was a lovely choice. I may start returning to \"bringing my own\" if they allow it.\nTwo guests shared the Beef Tartare which they loved.\nThose same guests had the muscles and sadly they were not impressed. We brought it to the attention of our waiter, and graciously they removed it from our bill.  The fries that came with the muscles were only barely warm and not served with any sauces :-(\nI had the pork chop, which was cooked perfectly but the brussel sprouts were almost raw and hard to cut and chew.\nAll this being said, we all do like this little gem and I will return.\nThe chicken looked amazing, that will be my next order.\nBrunch is quite good.\nAt the end our server brought us all a little after dinner port at no extra charge. They really do care about their guests and make every effort for you to have a good meal and a nice time.More"}
{"review":"A delightful, casual spot for a French dinner. Service was friendly, and our waiter was especially attentive. Both my wife and I settled for two identical appetizers--the French onion soup and escargot. Both lived up to our expectations and were ample for a meal.

{"review":"We've been dining at Chapeau for 30+ years and loving it -  Always a enjoyable and memorable dinner at Chapeau!  From cocktails and amuse-bouche through dinner, dessert and coffee, you'll feel indulged and at the same time, part of their family.  The owners, Philippe and...Ellen , both so charming -- There's no other restaurant in San Francisco who has this 'je ne sais quoi' quality about them.  A sheer delight, authentic, and a wonderful ambiance for a special evening!  Chapeau! is a 'must' for foodies and those seeking authentic French food and service.  Highly recommended!  Exquise!More"}
{"review":"We had an average dinner at Chapeau. The food was variable and expensive. The manager and server were charming and professional. We brought our own wine. The table next to us was very loud. We had a problem getting back to our hotel. Uber and...Lyft wouldn't come because the restaurant is too far west. We had difficulty getting a taxi. In the end the manager got us a taxi.More"}
{"review":"Unbelievably disappointing restaurant in every respect.  $40 for simple cassoulet, food cost $4.50, $22 glasses of wine and the menu is only half French, the rest is American, steak, or fish cooked Asian style.  Service is horrendous, we waited half an hour between finishing the...appetizer and the main course, with no one coming around the table to even check.  The whole fiasco was grossly expensive and of course included the dreaded surcharge which raised the bill another nine dollars.  If this is what dining at San Francisco has become now we\u2019re going to be eating at home a lot more.More"}
{"review":"Enjoyed our evening at Chapeau with great service, great food.  While there is a e course fixed price choice we decided on multiple appetizers and sharing a main which was accommodated with grace.  The executive chef visited each table to ensure that everyone was happy."}
{"review":"I cannot speak to their food.  We made reservation for June 17 2 months prior to that for a special occasion and were only in town for the weekend. They notified us 2 days before the day that an employee had tested positive for covid...so in an over abundance of caution they cancelled our dinner.  I commend their honesty and how they handled the situation.  I will probably never get a chance to visit SF again but if I did, I would love to try them!!More"}
{"review":"Different than the picture of the restaurant's interior, don't expect white tablecloths.  Our food was quite good, but the evening experience was affected by very loud ambiance, such to make conversation a chore. Service was poor. A smile and shout with an appearance and the...waiter is gone before you can reply. Just wait and wait to order desert. Or get a check. Small unkept restroom. Very friendly reception and exit. The service and the noise level were a significant distraction.More"}
{"review":"This was our first time to Chapeau and we had a great time. It's one of my sil and bil's favorite restaurants. The owner and staff are friendly and service was excellent.  We started with cocktails, I had a blueberry gimlet and my husband had...a Manhattan. I loved the gimlet! It had a nice amount of blueberry puree and the gin was tangy but not overpowering. My husband enjoyed his drink too. The guys split a plate of oysters. They said they were sweet and the Asian sauce complimented them well. I had the Mesclen salad for a starter. It was a generous portion and the dressing was flavorful. The crusted cheese was yummy and perfectly melted. My husband had the tomato soup. He said it was a bit sweeter than he expected. I had the cassoulet for my entree. The duck was nicely cooked and had good flavor. The sauce was savory and had nice flavor. The sausage was also good. My husband had the pork tenderloin. He said it was also perfectly cooked. For dessert I had the blueberry tarte and he had profiteroles. The tarte was scrumptious with blueberries and almond along with vanilla ice cream. The profiteroles were also delicious with a nice chocolate sauce.More"}
{"review":"Food, atmosphere, service...everything was great.  My wife rarely gets a filet mignon while we're out to dinner, because it rarely tops what we eat at home.  But, wow! ...she said it was perhaps the best ever.  My bouillabaisse was amazing and deserts where wonderful.  Well...deserved 5 stars.More"}

{"review":"There were no white table. clothes on our table. We were against a wall with 2 tops pushed together. If you like casual, this is the place for you. The food was outstanding. My husband and I shared  escargot, salad and the cassoulet. All were...delicious.  Oyster lovers in our party loved the oysters.More"}
{"review":"Charming French restaurant a little outside the city center, but not to be missed. The welcome by Philippe Gardelle, the chef, and his brother couldn't be more friendly, and the food was absolutely delicious. We devoured all 3 courses leaving only empty plates. Book early...to avoid disappointment. A total must when visiting SFO!More"}
{"review":"Had dinner last night at Chapeau for the first time. My first impression was pretty negative. When you\u2019re spending 200 bucks for a dinner for two people, especially the French restaurant, I kind of expected to see some white table cloths and some decent surroundings...but the place is kind of a hole.  Ripped seats, cheap tables and freezing inside.\nI have to admit that the food was excellent, although there wasn\u2019t enough of anything and even after three courses I was hungry in a couple hours. The service was great and the owner paid attention to every table. I only wish he had paid that much attention to my environment.More"}
{"review":"Easy, convenient, timely order-for-pickup service made for a good start. Filet mignon was cooked to perfection and potato au gratin was rich, delicious. However appealing other dessert options, I know the creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e will be outstanding. Chapeau did not have my wine selection, so they...voluntarily \"upgraded\" the vintage to Chateau Meyney 2015 (bordeaux), which is now my new favorite. Philippe and Ellen are unrivaled in his effort to ensure guest satisfaction andMore"}
{"review":"Still the same wonderful food prepared with love by Phillipe. Great wine list.  Nice to see some new additions to the menu, especially the fish selection. The new pudding like dessert is amazing as is the French toast and profiteroles. Outside dining with social distancing...is provided with great service.  Dress in layers as the weather can change in a nanosecond.More"}
{"review":"This was our first visit (we are from New York City a location with quite a few French restaurants) and we were overwhelmed by the service and the food. The maitre is a real character, but has complete control over the staff resulting in a...superb experience (very authentic).\nDon\u2019t miss it.More"}
{"review":"What a fun night! Everything we expected and more with wonderful cocktails and surprises along the way. Staff fantastic and even met a fellow Scottish barman along the way. Huge thanks again for  fun night."}
{"review":"Came for late night drinks with colleagues after an event. It is everything you expect. I did a little recon the day before to make sure I knew where we were going. It really is unmarked, big black door. When my group and I arrived...the next night, I rang the door bell and it took a few minutes before someone answered it. They did ask for the password. We were escorted in and seated right away. It was on a Tuesday and it wasn't busy at all. \n\nWe were a party of six and they seated us in a booth. I will say that it was very tight in that booth. The booths are probably better suited for a group of four. The menu is very overwhelming, but in a good way. Lots of options. The lighting is very dim and since we saw someone get yelled at for having their cell phone out, I didn't dare pull mine out to use the flashlight. Thankfully, each table has a little lamp. It came in handy. \n\nKeep in mind that there are no food options. Just drinks, but the drinks were so good. I had the cucumber gimlet which is often recommended in the reviews. It did not disappoint. AND on top of that, they were some of the most affordable drinks I had the entire week I was in traveling in California.\n\nI can imagine it might be more fun if there was a crowd in the place. Like I said, it wasn't busy on that Tuesday night at all. Our staff was very attentive and very informed on the menu. \n\nThis was fun and all of my colleagues enjoyed it. Put it on your list when visiting SF!More"}
{"review":"The drinks were excellent quality at a shockingly reasonable price (especially for SF). They have an extensive menu of classic and prohibition-style cocktails and the mixologist made some great recommendations. Be careful if going alone\/at night. It\u2019s on the edge of a questionable neighborhood."}
{"review":"Lovely traditional, speak easy style cocktail bar.\nBooking is required as numbers are limited and a password is requested to gain entry.\nInteresting, candle lit decor. It is really dark inside which adds to the atmosphere however,  because of the dim light I could not...read the cocktail menu at all and had to get someone to read it to me! Mobile phones are strictly not allowed so I couldn't even use my torch for some light. A bit embarrassing. \nSuper cocktails especially the signature Gin Gimlet and reasonably priced for a US City.\nOverall, a lovely evening and a great experience...More"}
{"review":"Wilson and Wilson Detective Agency is the speakeasy side of Bourbon and Branch. Reservations are required and they do limit the number of people who can enter which is refreshing so it's not crowded or loud. The cocktails were all fantastic and the service was...good. Our only two complaints would be the table we sat at was facing the window - which you can't see out of - instead of facing the bar. And the stools are HORRIBLE. They're not comfortable and they are difficult to move. Would go back anytime I'm in SF again.More"}
{"review":"This bar is an awesome hidden prohibition era speak easy esque bar, it's quite hard to find,look out for the Anti-saloon league advertising board and then the non descript wooden door underneath. Entry is strictly via booking only and you need to give it name...and the 'secret code-word'. Inside it's a very dark bar with a no mobile or photography policy which is refreshingly very nice. The drinks menu is great they serve some lovely cocktails and very thorough extensive list of bourbons and single malts. They play music fitting with what I would imagine the prohibition era would play and staff are dressed in 'peaky blinders' style clothing. When you have had a few nice drinks in here,pop next door to their sister bar  'The library' which is more casual and no bookings required. Both were very nice experiences. I would visit here again and recommend it to friends and familyMore"}
{"review":"Unique experience right from getting the password to leaving out a separate entrance. When we arrived at the unmarked door we were greeted by a gent in period garb who whispered to us to follow him inside. Perused the extensive menu and tried a few...different libations each. Romantic and fun night out. Helped to facilitate the date night atmosphere as no photos allowed so our phones stayed in our pocket. Only downside and it is a minor one- was that is was hard to read the menu with it being a dimly lit venue. Highly recommend this experience at least once but with the breadth of the drink list it would be great to return several times!More"}
{"review":"What a fun experience!  Love the fact you have to have a password to get in.  Once inside, the atmosphere is as you'd expect of an speakeasy...dimly lit and quiet.  The bartenders were great and the cocktails are top notch; don't go expecting to get...a beer.  Highly recommend for a cocktail before dinner.More"}
{"review":"This was a fun speakeasy experience. Once you get in, the bartenders are friendly and knowledgeable. The atmosphere is divine. The \"no photos\" rule makes for a great vibe inside. I appreciated feeling like I was personally being taken care of, and like I was...valued as a customer.More"}
{"review":"The feel and vibe is great. The whole \u201cpassword to get in\u201d and location in the seedy Tenderloin adds to it.  Each cocktail was top notch.  My only complaint would be the attitude of our server. He looked like the lead guy from Pitch Perfect...and was not very friendly. \n\nNow the extra info you need to know. The main bar (the one requiring the password) is not really a bar but rather a collection of tables that seat 4. There is NO bar \/ lounge atmosphere or mingling of any sort. It\u2019s true speakeasy - when you had to hide your presence. \n\nBut no worries. That is all fixed by passing thru the secret \u201cwall\u201d of books into the Library. Much more like a bar. It\u2019s open and they make most of the same drinks. There is a side entrance directly into this part but then you would miss the secret door. \n\nI didn\u2019t get to visit the detective agency part or the underground. Maybe next time. \n\nDon\u2019t be put off by the location (although be careful when you exit into that area). \n\nEnjoy.More"}
{"review":"Great experience, as they focus on the unique and secretive experience I won\u2019t go into too much detail.\nThe experience is entertaining, focusing on the speakeasy style, as you can only enter though a password and by following specific house rules. The bartenders are friendly...and very experienced, the environment is calm and relaxing. A must go and comfortable, tasteful night out.More"}
{"review":"Their twist is they are trying to be era-specific about the liquors. They say Bourbon wasn't drunk much and that they have few selections of it. Thus she suggested a Whiskey-based drink. She nailed the first drink, but the next mint-julep-inspired drink was a hit...and a miss--not terrible but just not great. Still, good to try something new. Look at your spam folder for the confirmation, because that's where the password went for me. Worst-case is you ring the bell and give them your last name from your reservation.More"}
{"review":"This speak easy is a hidden gem! Must have a reservation and a password to enter through the unmarked wooden door.  You will receive a list of rules including no cell phones or cameras. Dark and intimate, like going back in time!  Bar menu (no...food at all) has over 70 page menu with amazing and unique hand crafted cocktails, whiskey, bourbon, and other spirits. Fun time, should definitely give it a try!More"}
{"review":"By the name you know what to expect. The bourbon cocktails may be the best I've ever had, and that was a shared opinion in our group. The bartender however was a bit of a jerk. Service was slow. The whole place had a smell...that makes you wheezy. The whole song and dance to actually get in in the first place hits an early anti climax. But if you like a good bourbon, neat or in a cocktail, come here.More"}
{"review":"This place is not your normal bar. It is hidden, quiet and the cocktails are works of art. The idea behind the experience is to have you step back in time to a forgotten era when having a drink was actually illegal! Bourbon and Branch...nails it! \n\nThe start out, you must make a reservation. When you do an email is sent out confirming your spot, providing the address as well as your password. No password- No entry. Upon entering you really feel like you have stepped back in time to some hidden room. 20's music plays, the atmosphere is dark and quiet ( cell phones are not allowed). We got lucky and Manny was our bartender. Clearly a master of his craft, he expertly prepared our drinks and never let us down. Each drink was delicious and unique, truly something not experienced in a regular bar. \n\nIf your in the Bay Area and would like to try something new I highly suggest Bourbon and Branch. It is an experience that you will not soon forget. Also, for all you history buffs out there, Bourbon and Branch was actually a real speakeasy during the prohibition era! \n\nLastly, this place does not serve beer or things like Jack & Coke. These are craft cocktails so if you go be prepared to try something NEW.More"}
{"review":"This was our first time but it will definitely not be our last!  Bellotti was highly recommended and we were not disappointed. Kelsey, our server,  was gracious, patient, and gave us great suggestions. We decided to share what we ordered so we could sample more....Armed with a glass of Ros\u00e9 (it\u2019s summer!), we started with the salads. Both the  Anguria and the Insalata Burrata were refreshing and well put together. Next, we opted to try the Agnolotti de Lidia, Bigoli Al Sugo d\u2019Anatra, the Gnocchi alla Bolognese, and the Spaghetti Pomodoro E Burrata. The latter for its simplicity and its everyone\u2019s favorite type of pasta. We threw in some green beans to compliment. Wow! These pastas were just stunning in their flavors and textures. The beans stood their ground too.  We capped our meal with the Afogato, the coconut sorbet (why is it called a sorbet when it was so deliciously creamy?), a tiramisu in a glass, and the panna cotta with raspberry topping.  We all said we\u2019d be back to try other dishes, but we would likely come back for some new faves too.More"}
{"review":"I went to Belotti for dinner with a couple of friends - this was my first time there. We were seated outside on the wide sidewalk around the corner from the main entrance on College Avenue - there are a number of tables there. We...started with a small antipasto plate, and it was larger than we expected! Full of terrific items including prosciutto, salame Toscano, salamino Calabrese, three excellent cheeses, olives, sliced pear and apple, nuts, and a generous portion of crostini. The Americana salad was large and delicious, with arugula, beets, squash, goat cheese, toasted hazelnuts, and a tasty dressing that wasn't too sweet or overpowering. \n\nFor entrees, One of my friends had the Spaghetti Pomodoro e Burrata, and my other friend had the Casoncelli Bergamaschi - stuffed pasta with beef prosciutto, pork shoulder, Grana Padano, smoked pancetta, butter, and sage. Both looked great, particularly the Casoncelli. I had the Agnolotti di Lidia, a Piemontese style stuffed pasta with beef shank, flat iron, sausage, escarole, spinach, and Gran Padano, with a beef reduction sauce - absolutely amazing dish, everything went together perfectly. The portions for the main dishes were ideal for us - not overly large but by no means skimpy - really just right. I skipped desert but my friends had Tiramisu and Affogato al Caffe - big portions on those! \n\nBelotti has a large and very well-priced wine list, nearly all selections from Italy. We shared a bottle of Francone Grignolino from Piemonte - Grignolino is a variety I enjoy a lot and this bottle was excellent.\n\nService was efficient but friendly, low-key, and not obtrusive at all. Our server was helpful with a few questions we had about the menu choices and wine list. And the price of the meal for the quality was unbeatable! I've been hearing great things about Belotti for awhile and my first visit there lived up to my expectations and then some. Best dinner I've had this year, just outstanding, and I'll be sure to come back.More"}
{"review":"Some time ago, we were introduced to their takeout location further south in Oakland on Piedmont by our good friends.  You can check out our review by following us on Tripadvisor.  Having such a great introduction, we then found out about their main restaurant.  \n\nWe...went there for a late lunch, but their menu seems to be the same regardless.  Much like many others who've dined and reviewed this place, our meal was fantastic.  We made our reservations online and did arrive early and tried to get seated.  Understandably, they were jam packed inside and out.  That was ok because it gave us some extra time to explore the nearby shops\/stores.  It's located in the Rockridge area of Oakland and actually there's lots to enjoy and explore.  That's for another review though.  \n\nWe returned to the restaurant at 2:30 pm and got our table outside along the sidewalk.  At first, we were a little unsure about it because their website seemed to show they had a larger patio dining area (or so we thought).  Regardless, it turned out fine.  \n\nIt was obvious that they had a server staffing shortage based on our observation.  It took some time to get our server's attention and he was a little frazzled.  Once we had his attention, or he had ours, things went well.  It was easy to overlook the several slight missteps.  He made up for it with his entertaining, quirky style.  \n\nAs for the cuisine, it was \"to die for\".  My wife ordered their Lattuga (butter lettuce w\/ toasted pine nuts and lemon dressing) as her main dish, along with sides of Fagiolini (green beans) and Brussel sprouts.  All of that was amazing and with ample portions.  I ordered their Gnocchi alla Bolognese (potato gnocchi w\/ six meat sauce).  Again, it was just perfect.  \n\nFor beverages, my wife had the Pellegrino water and I ordered a glass of the Brunello di Montalcini.  While that glass alone was the most expensive item on the menu, it was delicious and worth the $24.00 price along.  \n\nSpeaking of price, all this great lunch experience was less than $100!!!  Wow!!!  I gave it a \"cheap eats\" selection, but it really is great food at a great price.\n\nIf you love classic Italian cuisine at a great price, this is the place to go.  We would return in a second.More"}
{"review":"We had a terrific dining experience at Belotti. Clearly, Belotti's know what they are doing. The food is outstanding. We tried two of the salads- the Americana and the Insalata Golasa. Both salads were beautifully presented . Both salads had interesting ingredients and both were...delicious. We tried the Pasta alla ligure and a pasta with duck sugo. Again, excellent. The wait staff did a great job.More"}
{"review":"It has been more than 2 years since we have visited Belotti\u2019s, a favorite of ours.  We arrived on a Friday at 1:30 pm and were lucky to get a table outdoors without reservations.  We started with the Belotti Antipasto (small)\u2014special treat; very generous serving....The strawberries and slices of pears were delicious, as well as the rest.  Afterwards we shared the Agnolotti, such delicate flavorsin a stuffed pasta.  They are very generous with their bread servings.  For dessert we shared the Bunet Piemontese\u2014a nice ending to a great meal.\n\nSeating outdoors is limited and you are sharing space with the coffee shop next door.  A favorite customer of Belotti\u2019s stopped by while we were there.  He came with his \u201cmom\u201d, sat quietly by the back door and waited for one of the cooks to bring him his treat, it was so cute (see photo).\n\nThe service was efficient and friendly, staff works very hard.  Belotti\u2019s is a must go to place.More"}

If can dine early, you can usually find a seat at the bar around 5ish.More"}

The quality of our food was very good, pasta and salads, and the portions were so large that we will be able to make 2 meals out of it all.

This is the most popular restaurant in Rockridge.More"}

The agnolotti was filled with a  mixture of meat though largely the beef came through. The beef reduction must have taken days! Delicious! My wife ordered the Casoncelli...which was equally delicious. This was a pork based meat filling. For pasta lovers you will have felt you won the lottery!  Atmosphere is a trattoria style, somewhat informal. Staff super knowledgeable. Great value too! Can\u2019t wait to return!More"}
{"review":"Another fab meal at Belotti. We can't dine here without getting the Golosa salad (so yummy) and the agnolotti, incredibly flavorful stuffed pasta. This time we ordered a second pasta, tortelli di polenta timo, and a main, brasato on a bed of polenta. We knew...we'd be taking some of it home, but guess what \u2013 we wanted that! Delicious wines, attentive service, sidewalk dining \u2013 a perfect evening.More"}
{"review":"Belotti has some of the best pasta I\u2019ve had in ages. I met a very good friend at this small restaurant for dinner one night and we had such a wonderful meal and shared a delicious crisp bottle of Nymphae Monferraro Bianco. I had not...seen my friend in two years thanks to the pandemic and we had a long two hour dinner until the waitress politely told us they had another reservation for the table! We shared an excellent bowl of marinated olives and bruschetta as appetizers. Next was the Anguria salad, watermelon, lime dressing, toasted almonds, mint, feta cheese- The kitchen was kind enough to split the salad to two portions and allowed us to share this item. Then, we had two excellent pasta dishes. Pappardelle Ai Fungi, long wide pasta, organic woods mushrooms, beef reduction, parsley, with Grana Padano\u2014excellent fresh pasta and perfectly prepared! Also, the wonderful Tagliatelle Al Cinghiale, long narrow pasta, grappa\/Sangiovese marinated wild boar Sugo, pecorino Toscano, black pepper\u2014 really superb! There was ample pasta for my dinner partner to take home the \u201cleftover\u201d and have for lunch the next day. She told me it was still as wonderful as the night before once it was reheat it! The service staff was professional and efficient and very patient as we caught up on many old times in our long conversation! The only distraction to the entire dinner was when I first walked in as the first customer of the evening and I stood there looking awkward for about 4-5 minutes while the staff was busy prepping and conversations were going on at the bar and I was totally ignored. I would\u2019ve love to get five stars, but they need to be more attentive to their clients!More"}
{"review":"Delicious Northern Italian fare, excellent street-side service by a mostly Italian wait team, and fine wine \u2013 who could ask for more? We enjoyed a Golosa salad, brasato with polenta, agnolotti stuffed pasta and a side of crispy brussels sprouts. A really yummy meal."}
{"review":"This is a neighborhood restaurant for us, so it was easy and a pleasure to order take out in Covid times.  They had it ready at the specified time and the quality was excellent.  Easy Peasey and we had a good meal.  Note that we...did not have a good experience here back when we ate indoors, so now we have turned the page and will be back.More"}
{"review":"Best pasta ever. Great atmosphere, food and staff. Love this place.  Fresh salads are great the wine list is extensive and reasonable."}
{"review":"I refer to Belotti as a bistro because of its small size and casual vibe. This is authentic Italian food at its finest. The antipasto is varied, with a good array  of meats and cheeses, the pasta was fresh with an impressive variety, and the...service was quite attentive. The wine selections were adequate, but the real star of the show is the food. Make your reservations early.More"}
{"review":"We went here our first night of San Francisco vacation.  We liked it so much we returned for the last dinner of our week.  The kitchen here is magnificent.  The first night we just had crab cakes and salads.  On our second visit my wife...had the salmon and I had the swordfish, and both were perfect.  (On the menu the swordfish came with sauce but I had them hold the sauce because I really like swordfish and saw no point in mutilating it with any herbs and spices.)  I also liked it that the room is big and bustling and full of life (if you've ever been to a Maggiano's Little Italy the vibe is like that).  There is also a harbor view which is nice during daylight.  Prices are reasonable, service is good.More"}
{"review":"Good crab cakes and chowder. Enjoyed the view over the marina. A busy place ... even on a late Wednesday afternoon. Friendly efficient service. Seems to be a cut above the other restaurants on Fisherman's Wharf"}
{"review":"Fresh from the airport we just wanted a light dinner. You front up, book in and wait in the lobby area a short while and are taken to your table in short order. The battered calamari and a burger fitted the bill. The lovely calamari...has a smattering of fairly powerful chilli and the chips and the burger were good and I had a choice of how I wanted the burger cooked. The wine was good and the service exceptional. The only downside was it\u2019s fairly noisy and no decaff coffee.More"}
{"review":"Thank you for your review! I am so pleased to hear you enjoyed the calamari, burger, wine, and our service. I hope you come back to see us next time you are in the area!"}
{"review":"This restaurant has rave reviews and on 1 hand I can see why, as the food is good. However, our experience was not the best. \n\nWe had visited Fog Harbour 15 years ago on our honeymoon and wanted to share the experience with our son...on our return. The restaurant has changed, which we expected but no for the best.\n\nThey started well, we were seated, my wife didn't like the table and they moved us. Fog Harbour is a popular restaurant and to get another table was great. Our server brought our menus and some table water and left. First thing I noticed the menu doesn't have all the drinks. Being a non drinker and having a 12 year old, we fancied a pepsi\/coke. They have these but none listed. Weird. \n\nWe were allowed a free starter as per a discount book and the waitress checked on this for us. They confirmed we could. My wife and son then ordered there starters, but asked if we could have a bit longer for mains. A few minutes later my free starter had come out, but not my wife or sons. I started eating and then 5 minutes later the rest of the starters arrived. I noticed around the restaurant that a few tables being seated were given bread rolls and butter on arrival. \n\nThen 5 minutes into us eating our starters our mains arrived. Not our regular server and I was quite surprised. I told the gentleman we were still eating our starters and to take them back. He looked confused, but did it. By this point we had been in the restaurant 30 minutes. It felt very rushed. For a restaurant where you can pay upto $100 for a main it felt like they wanted to turn tables, more than let you experience the meal. It felt like an expensive fast food restaurant. When you pay the prices that they charge dining experience should be relaxed, enjoy the experience. This was like an expensive table turn. Never have I experienced something like this at a supposedly up market restaurant. \n\nWe explained the situation about the mains with our server and she said that was strange. We finished our starters and our server asked if we wanted our mains. Now most restaurants we've eaten in usually give you a few minutes before serving mains, but knowing that they were sitting on the side in the kitchen to be served we felt obliged to say yes. \n\nI noticed more tables getting bread rolls and butter on arrival. Actually every table had got them since they had all been new after us. So I asked someone as they walked past. He confirmed it was complimentary and everyone got it. Would we like it, at that point I declined as we were halfway through our mains. Then a minute later our main server came over and mentioned that I had asked about it. No apology, or she had made a mistake, which would have been fine. She preceded to lie right to our faces and said everyone had asked for it. Which was a lie, because people were getting it as soon as they were seated. At the point I told her she was lying and stop the conversation. I then asked to see the manager. \n\nMario the manager came over and by this time we had been in the restaurant for an hour. I mean it was ridiculous how quick this meal had gone. I explained the situation to Mario about the meals coming out quickly and the lack of bread rolls. Initially he tried to explain that in the US that food is brought out when it is ready. Now having visited the US numerous times over the years, from East to West, North to South that is rubbish. My wife mentioned that we had visited previously although 15 years ago and then he questioned if that was correct as he had only been there 7 years. I mean come on Mario, things do exist before you found them.  He admitted with the bread rolls that the server had lied and if she had apologised it would have been better. I wasn't complaining for a discount but to help develop staff. If you can't admit to a mistake how can you learn. If she had apologised and said it was an error, I would have still tipped 20 to 30% because she was attentive but to lie to a customer is wrong. Mario offered a discount but I wasn't doing this for a discount, I was annoyed at being lied to, so declined the discount. \n\nOn the whole we were treated differently to everyone else and having a wife and son of an ethnic origin this annoys me more that most. The food is good, not great for the price they charge. I honestly would shop around before picking to go here in the futureMore"}

{"review":"I visited San Francisco on 9\/18\/2023 and I researched this restaurant and I was looking forward to the food.  I was VERY VERY disappointed.  The service was awful and the food.  I ordered the lobster stuffed salmon.  The presentation, taste and service was not up...to par.  I received my salmon and it was broken and torn as you will see in the picture, served to me with sprinkles of lobster that you can barely see. Noone should EVER visit a restaurant and receive food presented this way.  There was sauce that could have been flavorful but the entire dish had not one but of seasoning.  IT HAD NO TASTE!! This was weird to me that the sauce would be tasteless.  I had my husband try it and he was surprised that it was no taste to the food and even the sauce especially since it is seafood.  I shared with the waitress and she brought me salt and pepper to season my own food.  I used seasonings that are NO SALT when I cook at home so I would not use the salt she provided.  I would not recommend this restaurant.  Save your money.More"}

{"review":"I am a Pizza Aficionado and travel the World for pizza with my family! We came out to San Francisco, CA in 2021 and this place was a must for us.  The pizza did not disappoint.  We ordered a Margherita pie. It delivered the freshest...ingredients with cheese and tomatoes from Italy. It had a chewy crust and was delicious from beginning to end. Pizza was a bit floppy towards the point but the taste was great!More"}
{"review":"The food was really good, as was the house red wine, though the service was sometimes lacking. \n\n(And I resent what too many restaurants call a \"SF Mandate Fee\" --- these restaurants are required to provide healthcare for their workers or pay a fee, just...as there are other requirements for businesses, including rent, insurance, electricity, wages, etc., but they are not required to charge that fee to customers, as they seem to imply.)More"}
{"review":"Went in on a whim. Sat at the bar. Great atmosphere. Loud but in a good way. Lots of different people. Could watch the pizzas being made in the wood fire oven. Service was okey. Food was really good. Had a pasta, a pizza and...an amazing tiramisu. Would highly recommend this place.More"}
{"review":"After a mammoth day biking the Golden Gate Bridge and all-around San Francisco, we fancied some tasty carbs.  Il Casaro (in the Castro) was close to our hotel and had good reviews so was ticking all of our boxes.\n\nThis restaurant is fitted out well,...very open plan and with a nice canteen type vibe, not at all stuffy or pretentious.  The service was attentive, and our server was able to recommend local beers as alternatives to better known branded lagers.\n\nWe ordered two pizzas, I opted for the Patata pizza, which had slices of potato on it, as it sounded different to anything I had tried before.  My partner had the Broccoli and Salsiccia, again because it sounded unusual.  Both were delicious, although neither came with a tomato sauce base, which was not a negative because both were delicious, but it just threw us a little bit.  The pizzas were also large, despite our post biking hunger we couldn\u2019t finish them so took a couple of slices back to our hotel and had them the next day.\n\nThe menu prices, for San Francisco was reasonable.  All in all a very good choice and I would highly recommend.More"}
{"review":"Popped in for a slice of late lunch life in little Italy. Really nice feeling of the place and love the open air windows to the street.  Place was full at 3 pm but for good reason. Pizza was slow to arrive but man was...it good. We had mortadella pistachio and calabrese - both were excellent and there were no survivors. Yum! Only improvement would be to fill my wine glass a little more full next time - but overall this restaurant truly believes pizza should fun and accessible- not pretentious and expensive. Great stuffMore"}
{"review":"Amazing pizza, as good as in Italy, outside setup cold be better and waiter should be more friendly. We were here for a pizza for lunch and we were not disappointed."}
{"review":"There are many places to eat in North Beach.  A few of our favorite places was closed so we had heard about Il Casaro and decided to stop in for lunch.  We decided to eat in the outdoor parklet which was very nice.  There seemed...to be some confusion around the service because we had two waiters none of which were available during our meal and it was difficult to figure out who would help us.   We were able to order the wine and the salad which were both good.  The  salad had romaine, pine nuts, cheese ($13) We then flagged down a waiter and ordered the Calabrian Chile, sausage, tomato and basil ($18.50)  The pizza was a bit soggy and the cheese was cold, we have had better elsewhere.   I would hesitate to return here when there are so many other choices in the area.More"}
{"review":"Stopped here for a quick lunch after a bus tour  round the city. The food was delicious but sadly the service let it down as we were not made to feel welcome at all and the manager barely looked at us never mind spoke when...we were ordering.

{"review":"Enjoyed delicious pizza at Il Casaro on two occasions, both times were great. It's great for sit-down pizza, especially if you're meeting a friend or family member, but even solo-dining here is great. \n\nService was satisfactory on both visits and prices aren't too bad, not...really cheap and not really too expensive either. There's certainly plenty of options for pizza nearby, but this one for me is a solid choice on any day.\n\nLove their parklet outside as well. That was really needed in this area.More"}

{"review":"We went there because my husband was craving pizza. Granted, the pizza was good. However, nearly everything had meat, and fatty meat at that. We don't eat pork, so that rules out sausage and pepperoni, but this place even had salami and mortadella (which was...gross). We didn't try any of the pasta, but it looked good. Make a reservation or you'll never get in. And don't expect speedy service.More"}

I could not finish my meal.  \n\nThe atmosphere and service was good, but the food was not.\n\nI could not recommend this eatery.More"}
{"review":"2nd time having breakfast at this restaurant. Unfortunately this last time was disappointing. First the decor seems fresh and light when you walk in, however, when walking towards the table you notice the white fabric chairs are stained and dirty. Second we were asked if...we were ready to order and we were, but then the waitress said one moment and walked away. She never came back and we had to ask someone else to take our order. Third, we asked for a little cup of salsa and we were charged $1.50. Thought that was a bit much considering we had ordered breakfast items that totaled $100.00+. I think what was a bit unusual were signs on the walls indicating patrons would be surcharged for cleaning \"incidentals\" associated with intoxication. Just not an overall great dining experience.More"}

I THINK it\u2019s $25 and only good for one hour and 15 min....I had the roasted chicken omelet and as healthy and boring as it sounds, it tasted super good.  The tomatillo sauce was everything.  We ate about noon time, and I didn\u2019t eat again until dinner around 7pm.  Portions are pretty fabulous here.  The hubby got a basic breakfast, but it tasted better than just basic.  \n\nWould come back again and host a girl\u2019s brunch.More"}

{"review":"I don\u2019t really leave any reviews at all but this place triggered me to do so! My friend recommended this place. So i went and the service was awful! This place is such a disappointment! In terms of their bottomless mimosa they will require all...the party to get it even though one or two people are not drinking or don\u2019t drink at all but they still gonna require you to get it cos it\u2019s requirement for them which is ridiculously obnoxious! The service crews are gonna talk about you if you have any comments about their service and food. It\u2019s not worth it to go on this place just to eat breakfast. Their hash browns were dry and bland and the staff didn\u2019t seem to know how to check out of state IDs. The Manager is not even trying to make accommodations at all! Would not recommend this place!More"}

The chorizo omelette was large and full of meat.  They had a soothing \u201clounge\u201dbackground music playing, which was...noticeably different from many places.  Service was fast, considering the crowd.  Some of the tables are near the door.  This is a cold place most mornings of the year.  Sit farther inside.More"}

{"review":"We had so much fun at Sotto Mare - it was Halloween and the vibe was great. Jazzy music from across the street, jovial tables outdoors, perfect service and great food.  There were well behaved Trick or treaters everywhere. We were concerned that the menu...had a lot of seafood, but there was A wonderful selection of fish on the specials menu such as  Halibut, Branzino, Ahi, Sea Bass etc with a selection of cooking styles\/sauces we could choose from. Our friends had the Cioppino and raved about it - And they live in SF.  My Branzino in Capers & Lemon was beautiful as was my husband\u2019s Halibut. Everything was far better than we had expected. House salad was amazingly great and generous with a selection of dressings that were made in house. Wine is reasonable too - especially for California restaurants. North Beach is not the dining Mecca it was 30-40 years ago, but Sotto Mare was packed and just as good as ever. I cant wait to return.More"}

{"review":"Super busy place.  We showed up about 15 minutes after opening on Friday.  Sitting at the bar.  Small restaurant.  Mostly, you will likely sit at the bar at busy times.  Ordered the sole and the shrimps and scallop sauteed & a small order of the...pasta with pesto sauce.  Portion - decent.  The sole is a full portion & the seafood comprises 4 shrimps and 3 scallops.  Taste was just OK for both.  The pesto pasta was atrocious...  Way over cooked and the pesto sauce had zero taste...  We normally do not sprinkle salt but ended up putting some just to eat.  Left 3\/4 of the pasta.  Not sure why this is rated so highly.  BTW - the bread was just like something you get at a grocery store.  No flavor nor texture.  Also, the female wait staff was atrocious....  Super rude and she acted like she really doesn't want to be there.More"}
{"review":"We have eaten at Sotto Mare many times over the years and are always eager to return!  They are known for their cioppino but everything is delicious. The  fish is fresh and cooked to perfection-my husband always gets the lemon-butter-caper sauce. Entrees are accompanied with...fresh vegetables for a satisfying portion. For the vegetarian they offer pasta with a few different toppings-the half size is a large serving. The sourdough bread is crusty with a soft interior. The place is small and does not take reservations. The servers are busy but super friendly and never make you feel rushed. Eat outside weather permitting or couples can enjoy sitting at the bar.More"}
{"review":"The place is full of chaos, cramped and noisy. The service runs around without a hitch. They throw cutlery and shout at each other. The food has little to do with Italian cuisine - the pasta sauce was completely tasteless, no seasoning. At the end,...the woman serving us ran after us shouting down the street and demanding a huge tip, even though neither she nor the food deserved a cent. She started insulting us and calling us names, taking out her frustration with her dissatisfaction with her salary. She refused to return the card, threatening to add the tip herself. We have never experienced such poor service before! Absurd!More"}

One had salmon which was good, two pasta, which was ok and 2 shared the ciopinno. It was full of seafood, the sauce was just ok.

{"review":"This restaurant makes the best cioppino, hands down. We came at the nudge of my brother who has been a chef in SF for many years. This restaurant did not disappoint! We were a family of 3 and had the seafood louie salad, with the...cioppino. It was the best I've ever had. All the workers there made us feel like family. Love this place!!!!!!More"}
{"review":"Loved the atmosphere, service and incredible food we had the pleasure to enjoy at this fabulous place. The steamed clams were in a delicious broth and my daughter and I shared the incredible Crab, with tons of seafood Cioppino. The Risotto on the side was...to die for! My husband had the perfectly prepared, delicious Halibut with pasta. Our waitress was efficient, friendly and a marvel to behold as she navigated the many happy diners that filled the place. Loved the casual family atmosphere. What a treasure!!!More"}

{"review":"Stumbled across this place on our way back from a tour to Muir Woods, and quite honestly, it's the best deli sandwich I have ever eaten! I would happily travel back here from the UK just to have another sandwich."}

{"review":"We visited Sausalito for the first time and stumbled across this amazing cafe deli on the waterfront by chance. Two days later and we are back again. The food and service is outstanding. If you want fresh healthy food with great service this is where...you need to be. The lady who served us both times remembered us and the food and drink that we liked. Such a lovely chilled atmosphere and welcoming and accommodating. Would highly recommend.More"}
{"review":"We had booked a SF Excursion tour of SF, Sausalito, & Muir Woods and our tour guide suggested this restaurant for a casual lunch stop. \n\nSuch a varied menu of sandwiches, salads, and pizzas!  And the servers were very friendly!!!!!! They knew that we had...a limited amount of time for our lunch time so they really \"hustled\" to have our food delivered to our table quickly so that we would have ample time to enjoy both it and the great view of the waterfront.\n\nI enjoyed their Classic Sandwich combo of turkey breast, Black Forest ham, cheddar cheese, along with the usual lettuce, tomato, & onion. There were four choices of breads so I picked the Dutch Crumble bread......great-tasting and not as thick as usual sandwich bread.  My spouse tried the California Club Sandwich...turkey breast, Black Forest ham, fresh avocado, and the lettuce\/tomato.onion on sourdough bread.   Very fresh-tasting!\n\nIf you're staying or visiting in Sausalito, we highly recommend Venice Gourmet for a quick, great-tasting lunch.More"}

{"review":"Our tour guide from SF Excursions recommended Venice Gourmet as a lunch stop when we told him we'd like to have pizza and sandwiches.  We were a large group of 9 and Irma jumped to action and quickly accommodated us.  Her warm welcome enhanced our...experience.  The sandwiches, salad and pizza were all very delicious.  \nVenice Gourmet is a great place to have lunch and soak in the spectacular view.  We all loved it.More"}
{"review":"Good food, great service,  Waterfront eating.  Easily accessible to shops and was a great stop on our tour."}

{"review":"What a delicious spot.  Came from SF to check out Sausalito and the Muir Woods and stopped here for lunch.  The sandwiches were divine and the staff worked quickly getting everything made as you order.  Love the deli\/specialty food store options available and the shop...is directly across from the bay.  Perfect to grab food and sit and watch life pass by.More"}
{"review":"This is a lovely place overlooking the coast of Sausalito with indoor and outdoor seating commanding views of downtown San Francisco and Alcatraz. A quick stop here didn\u2019t cause any issues for the friendly lady who served up a mighty salad and pastrami and Swiss...cheese sandwich. Tasted great. Not bad on the wallet too. Well worth a visit if you are hungry and want good service with a good, quiet and relaxing view.More"}

{"review":"Visited here with a group of colleagues. The staff are so friendly and welcoming but I did not feel the food was that good. The pasta was extremely bland, the bread was dry and hard, the salads were quite nice, the chicken was plain, the...vegetables were nicely cooked. Overall I wasn\u2019t that impressed by the experience but I think maybe it\u2019s more a case that they don\u2019t excel at cooking at scale for a big group. Probably nicer if you order a la carte.More"}
{"review":"Our dining experience at IDEAle was truly an exceptional, fun experience.  From the moment we walked in, we felt right at home.  We began with drinks  at the bar, best Negroni we\u2019ve ever had.  Dinner exceeded expectations.  Thank you IDEALe!"}
{"review":"This place was recommended to us by a local in San Francisco, and the food did not disappoint. It was tasty and the staff was very kind. 5\/5 stars for sure and we recommend for anyone looking for very authentic Italian. We ordered the calamari,...gnocchi, and fish of the day which was halibut. Each dish was extremely fresh and none of it was heavy, yet our stomachs were left satisfied. For dessert we had the Millefoglie which was also delicious and different from what you normally find. Great experience!More"}
{"review":"My longtime, go-to Italian restaurant in North Beach.  Away from the Columbus Ave crowds it serves down home, elegant pastas - most costing about $20 a plate which allows you to include a good wine from their wine wall."}

{"review":"Excellent food, prompt service, nice vibe! We had the gnocchi and Amatriciana pasta, both delicious"}
{"review":"Perfect Italian authentic restaurant when enjoying North Beach neighborhood. I lived in San Francisco and I live in northern Marin and for my friends birthday I got us tickets to dear San Francisco, which is a wonderful show at Club Fugazi just three blocks away...from this great restaurant! Paolo took wonderful care of us. His wine, suggestions and appetizer and entr\u00e9e tips were the best! The pasta is homemade and very delicious and special. We tried the gnocchi with pesto, as well as a delicious braised meat, red sauce over fresh linguine. We also enjoyed the grilled not fried octopus the tiramisu for dessert was perfect! I\u2019ve been here before, and I will go back again and again for the service and authentic delicious Italian cuisine.More"}

{"review":"Dinner was fantastic.  Thought we went to Italy.  Will definitely be back.  The food was all fresh and sauce incredible.  Great service and atmosphere"}
{"review":"Devo dire che sono molto, molto felice che Ideale continui nello stesso posto, con o senza pandemia. Bravo, Maurizio! Auguri a tutti! \n\nNot only are they still there, in a somewhat unlikely spot in the, uhm, ugliest, most touristy area of North Beach. \nAbove all...they\u2019re persistently preparing the best, in the sense of most authentic, Roman food in SF. How do I know? Well I can tell: I used to live up the steep hill on Vallejo and this was my dining room years ago. Years later, I can tell because as a food critic, I look at menus all the time: These guys are just doing their thing: best pasta (amatriciana, carbonara, gricia, caccio pepe), original salads (orange-fennel), and the best Tiramis\u00f9 in town. They also have an impressive selection of carefully chosen Italian wines. Maurizio\u2019s wife is the artist of the paintings that I always wanted to have (no chance, so I have to go eat there more often). \nAnother plus: Food is reasonably priced compared to old and new competitors down on Green. \nSince the food kinda flew into my mouth - I had orecchiette with broccoli rape - no pictures here.  It\u2019s about the taste anyway.  I\u2019ll be back.More"}
{"review":"This was a great Italian restaurant in North Beach.  We ate here while vacationing the week of Christmas.  All the dishes were great and the wine list was excellent.   Staff was very friendly and most were originally from Italy, giving a unique spin to this...dinner out.More"}
{"review":"Good location near Colombus. Authentic Italian food and great guys. Especially the mexican guy. Fine wines. Loved it!!!"}
{"review":"Note: we did a multiple week trip to Italy last year, and hoped for a similar dining experience. We were disappointed.\n\nWe looked up nice places to eat in North Beach in an older edition of Lonely Planet (2009), and we ended up here.\n\nWe...ordered spaghetti cacio e pepe and paccheri all'amatriciana, two classic Italian pastas we are both familiar with. After waiting 45 (!) minutes, the dishes were delivered by one of the three generally arrogant and unfriendly waiters. The pastas were very 'al dente', and both our sauces were below average. \n\nThe restaurant was loud, and the lighting seemed to fail every once in a while for a split second.\n\nWhen we asked for the bill, we waited for 15 minutes before trying to figure out what was taking so long. We saw our waiter talking and laughing near the bar... I went to the register and one of the other waiters pointed this back to me for 10 minutes before another one took over??\n\nDon't come here unless you like below average Italian food and inefficient staff.More"}
{"review":"Our meal was possibly the best Italian meal I have had outside of Italy. The restaurant itself had a fun vibe, and the staff was very friendly and helpful. The wine we ordered wasn\u2019t available, so he suggested a Sangiovese that was a perfect compliment...to our meal. We had a delicious tortellini dish and lasagna\u2026which I never order in a restaurant\u2026both were amazing! Clearly fresh and homemade pasta made the difference. We will try to go again before we leave town!More"}
{"review":"We took advantage of their daily special of black cod. Fantastic dish, very fresh, cooked to perfection and served on a bed of citrus infused risotto. Service was great. We brought a nice Pinot Noir with us. Buckeye charges $33 corkage. This place never disappoints....Please bring back the Banana Foster's dessert.More"}
{"review":"Family birthday. Food good as always, service uneven & inattentive.  They have crammed way too many tables in dining room & noise makes even  a 4pm reservation uncomfortable.

{"review":"Stopped mid-afternoon for a late lunch after visiting Muir Woods. Everything served was perfect. Smoked wings, burgers, and flank steak with truffle fries. Despite the outside seating location far from the restaurant core, the service was attentive. A very satisfying meal."}
{"review":"When this amazing restaurant opened its outside patio for dining, we took advantage of the moment for a quiet birthday celebration. Even though it was just the two of us, it was a very special moment because it was just the second time we had...eaten out since the pandemic. \nMeandering through the inside dining room to get to the patio, after the temperature check at the door, it felt safe clean and safe AND pleasantly occupied by dining teddy bears. \nThe patio tables were set up well apart from one another and everyone honored the rules to mask up whoever the masked server came around to inquire about the food, any extra needs, and just to see if all was well with us and everyone else. It was a really pleasant and memorable evening, especially with the delicious meal we were served.More"}
{"review":"I got this recommendation from a local friend, and it did not disappoint. The menu has something for everyone, from a less adventurous eater to a real foodie.\n\nFried foraged mushrooms, oysters bingo, and the s\u2019mores pie were standouts.After the appetizers my friend and I...split the fish special which was prepared expertly; a tipped hat to the saucier as well.More"}
{"review":"After 50 years of restaurant dining in eateries and fine dining establishments all over the  world, dining out simply doesn\u2019t hold the allure it once did. That\u2019s why our recent dinner with friends at the Buckeye prompted this review: it still has the chops that...makes dining out worth the effort! Classic decor, great wait staff, fantastic food and a fun vibe. Have fun and we hope your dinner is as satisfying as ours was!More"}
{"review":"This is our fallback restaurant. You can count on good service from the Valet Stan to the consistent fare. We have been going for more than 30 years. Other Marin restaurants have come and gone, but Buckeye has survived by quality, service, and price. Make...sure you make a reservation in advance. If you bring your own wine, the corkage is reasonable.More"}

My only mistake was once sitting at the bar, instead of the dining area, when II ordered the ribs, and, even though I asked for...them to be separated in the kitchen, I didn't want to pick up and chew at the bones at the bar.\nThey were so delicious!More"}
{"review":"Great returant atmosphere, wine list,cocktails, service food and service. The menue offers a reat selections the calf liver is tops  along with other entrees. The salads appetizers, oysters are all great. The bar is neat. We always celebrate at Buckeye when there."}
{"review":"My partner took me here as a surprise for my birthday and I loved it. The ambiance was good, and on a busy night they were able to get us seated a little earlier than our reservation time. I loved their wine selection and we...shared our meals halfway through. I got the lamb and he got the fillet. The fillet was amazing. Would definitely go again.More"}

{"review":"I called to book a reservation in January. I explained to the hostess that I was traveling from the arctic circle and had read a review online that stated that this was the best restaurant in the USA. I am in San Francisco for two...days and would love a chance to try the prime rib. I was told that there were no tables for two available but I could come back in March or line up when I am in town in January and I might get a table. If I was with a group of 6 or more they could also accommodate me in January. I don\u2019t understand how they have tables for 6 or more but no table of 2. I ended up booking at Morton\u2019s. I have dined at Morton\u2019s before and the service and food are outstanding. It\u2019s unfortunate that this restaurant rest my wife and I a table.More"}
{"review":"I\u2019ve been waiting years to try the House of Prime Rib and it absolutely exceeded my expectations. \n\nI had to book a ways in advance and made a quick trip to San Francisco out of it, and it was worth it. \n\nWe were quickly seated...and it was just as I envisioned. Red leather booths with green walls. Little metal blimps full of prime rib all around the restaurant. Our server quickly greeted us with bread and water. We enjoyed small slices of bread but wanted to save ourselves for the real show. \n\nI ordered the house cut (11oz) and she ordered the city cut (7oz). Both medium rare. We also opted for a bottle of Merlot instead of cocktails. The wine service was great and the selection was impressive. \n\nThe house salad came out quickly and it was a nice show to watch our sever spin in the dressing and toss it. The cold fork they present you is a nice touch for the salad. \n\nNext came the main course. A plate filled with prime rib, mashed potato\u2019s and cream corn. The server also carved up some Yorkshire pudding for us, table side. Each bite was better than the last. \n\nIt was such a hearty portion but the beef was tender and flavorful. The sides were simple but perfect. \n\nFor dessert we orders two espressos and one cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e. It was the perfect ending to our meal. \n\nEverything about this place was perfect. The service was first-class and the food was fantastic. It\u2019s such an iconic restaurant. An old school feeling with a simple menu. Just tell them how much meat you want and how to cook it. Let them handle the rest. \n\nIt took everything in me not to steal a plate for my own collection. I wanted to keep as many souvenirs as possible to remember such a great dining experience.  I cannot wait to visit the House of Prime Rib again.More"}
{"review":"My title says it all! \n\nIf you are thinking of coming here (which I couldn\u2019t recommend more) book months in advance! \n\nProbably the most popular restaurant in San Francisco and it deserves every bit of the success it has!"}
{"review":"The service staff and food does not disappoint. Made reservations 6 weeks in advance (deposit required).  Should have made sooner for better time selection.  We also added our name to the cancelation list and got in 90mins earlier. \n\nTable side preparation and service. Friendly, attentive...staff that welcomes photos and will take group photos of guests. \n\nCome hungry. Staff will gladly wrap leftovers.More"}
{"review":"Every elegant steakhouse.  Very pricy but the best prime rib I have ever had.  Very loud and noisy with lots of partys and get togethers going on, so if you are looking for a quite place to eat, this is not the place for you....They cook and slice it just the way you want it.  The sdlad is wonderful and tossed right on front of you.  They have huge portions and you will definitely go home with a doggy bag.  So worth the experience.More"}
{"review":"Second visit to the house of prime rib. \n\nWas disappointing, given the price and reputation of the restaurant. Service was dismissive at best. The prime rib was okay, but came swimming in a sea of gravy and mash potatoes. The best aspect of the dinner...was the salad and an adequately-made martini \n\nWould not repeat. There are better options in SF.More"}
{"review":"Wow! This place is Busy! Energetic! And Yummy!!! But you need to like steak!!!!!! Fish was on the menu for someone who can\u2019t eat it, but that\u2019s it! Only come if you are a meat lover!! It is totally DEVINE!! Your knife (which is huge)...will go through the steak like butter. Don\u2019t eat for a week before! There is mash (moderate portion) or jacket potato which is ginormous !!! Then creamed spinach or creamed corn. \nAlso the kids meal is only for under 8\u2019s and a main portion is getting on for 50 dollars. Your older  kids need big appetites or you need a doggy bag!!! Waiting staff make a spectacular show and tend to your every need.\nTotally recommend if you are in San Francisco and love steak!!! I would definitely return.More"}
{"review":"I had an absolutely dreadful experience at the House of Prime Rib. To start, our waiter was extremely odd, making strange comments about myself and my partner, who is African American. It was uncomfortable to be around him and we were on edge during our...dining experience. \n\nTo make matters worse, we were misinformed by our waiter that the au jus had pork in it, which was a big problem for us as we don't eat pork. We were only told at the end of our meal, once our leftovers had been packed up, that the waiter was mistaken about the pork in the au jus. You can imagine how disappointing it is to eat prime rib without the au jus. It's honestly impossible to have a good prime rib without au jus, so this mistake was unacceptable.\n\nAs if that wasn't enough, as we were leaving, the waiter chased us down and accused us of not paying our bill. We had already paid his manager, who had informed us about the waiter's mistake with the au jus. It was an embarrassing and humiliating experience, and I would never recommend this restaurant to anyone. The service was terrible, it was impossible to enjoy the food without the au jus and the overall experience was deeply upsetting.More"}

{"review":"This place lives up to it's legendary name. Regardless of the price (we are in SF, mind you), the food will not let you down. I was lucky enough to find a spot at the bar as a solo diner on this particular Friday night....It was packed with long waits for non-solo diners and even though I had to wait about 10 minutes to be sat, it wasn't a bad experience. As well, the bartender, Shar, was very kind and respectful and didn't make me feel out of place although, at times, I felt such due to how busy it was and the money that was flowing all around me. He was an amazing bartender and his old fashion's were top notch and quickly poured even with all the clientele he had.More"}

Just...need to visit and enjoy. :)More"}
{"review":"I visit San Francisco about once a year. I always try to make it here each time. I leave thinking this not only was one of the best meals of the year, but also the best service we\u2019ve had.

The spinach looked terrible (think baby poop) - but everyone was still raving about it the next day.

Bar staff was wonderful and the drinks were excellent: a martini and a manhattan. We were escorted to our table when...our daughter and her husband arrived.  Staff was knowledgeable and friendly.  We started with the olives but preferred our daughter\u2019s pecans.     My husband and I shared the lamb which was delicious.   The beans that accompanied it were  also outstanding. Mourad will be a place to which we will return when in town.More"}
{"review":"Terrible experience at this restaurant. Initially we were very excited to try this restaurant. However, shortly after sitting down to order, my elderly(over 80 years old) father's chair collapsed as he was moving the chair forward. The chair legs had collapsed causing him to fall...backwards. My father does not weigh more than 150 lbs. The manager on duty was called over by the waiter. The manager immediately removed the chair and was unapologetic, uncaring and not helpful. We asked the manager to call an ambulance. Overall a very terrible experience and since this happened shortly after ordering, we obviously did not try the food. The restaurant is also very dark. Extremely poor management that evening. We were very disappointed.More"}
{"review":"The service is not appropriate for the prices of the restaurant . Nothing to say about the food and the quality of the products. We had a delicious dinner even though was very expensive. In 3 people we spent 400\u20ac . I understand the price...because as I said the quality of the of the food and wine was very high. I am strongly disappointed by the service and I will explain why: we left  generous tips and we ordered many things but when we asked if they could call a taxi for us ( since we are tourists and we had no phone services ) they refused to do it because this service \u201c wasn\u2019t their job\u201d . I believe that a fancy and expensive restaurant should help their clients especially for such a small favour . I don\u2019t rucoumed the restaurant for the service because they just want that the client order many things and spend money .More"}
{"review":"Our dinner for four was sumptuous. Service was excellent and extremely attentive. Food was multi-layered and thoughtful, and we were so happy and round by the time we finished the main meal we had no room for dessert. Particular standouts were the eggshuka and milk...bread, the duck basteeya and a shared entree of the short ribs with shiitake, niitaka and bone marrow with a side of heirloom beans. Expensive meal but very, very delicious.More"}

{"review":"While I would probably have given this restaurant a higher score the service just made it a less than a superb experience.  We really didn't appreciate how good the food was until our group got together at Gary Danko the next day and discussed our...experience at Mourad.  The milk bread rolls were really the only disappointment - our table of 5 did not even finish 1 order.  \n\nService - When we sat down, we wanted to order some wine and a couple of appetizers to start, then told the waiter we would be ready to order the rest of the food by the time the appetizer was served.  He said their kitchen didn't work that way - we had to order everything at once. ???  That's a new one on me and everyone else at the table.  It just started the service on a bad tone.\n\nWe were ill advised on an appetizer order, we started with 3 but the waiter said 2 would be enough.  The plating size was much smaller that pictures on this website and the waiter told us that each of us would have 3 or 4, but what he meant was there three or four pieces on each plate.  Hardly enough to give 5 people two pieces each.  Then he forgot one of our entree's.  Every mishap was pointed towards us not ordering properly.  It just made all of us at the table very uncomfortable.  \n\nSitting at Gary Danko, where the service was impeccable helped us to remember that the food was mostly excellent, but the experience was ruined by the server's attitude.   There are enough reviews about the food and pictures, I wont' go into those.  Just wanted to give our perspective on our experience.More"}
{"review":"For a Michelin starred restaurant, this did not live up to expectations. I left a message to change our reservation from 2 people to 6. They never called back. I was able to do this on line, but not for the same time. My husband...and I arrived early to sit at the bar and have a drink before the rest of our party came. They offered to seat us at our table upon arrival, so apparently they could have kept our reservation for the same time but not calling me back was not what I expect from this level of restaurant. It was a very pretty space. The head of the beverage service was the most personable and professional person we encountered here. When we were seated and our waiter found out we hadn't been there before, he was very knowledgeable about the menu and explained it well. However, he pressed us to order doubles of the appetizers and other small plates. We did not want that much food so we could try more things. He was very pushy and not pleased when we did not follow his recommendations on quantity. It was a relatively small annoyance in the grand scheme but I would not hurry back here and I would never recommend this restaurant when there are so many fabulous restaurants in this city.More"}

My...review from November is worth repeating because it speaks to the consistency of the excellence on display by the chefs and servers.\n \nMy November review\u2026\u2026\u2026\nA Standout Meal - expertly crafted and tasty cuisine!!  If you\u2019re looking for a meal that\u2019s absolutely \u201cfull of flavors,\u201d super-tasty, and definitely great value for money then reserve a spot at chef Mourad Lahlou\u2019s \u201cMourad.\u201d The restaurant craftfully blends Moroccan cuisine and spices with Northern California\u2019s local and fresh ingredients to produce stunningly delicious food. It\u2019s hard to pick a favorite when each dish is so exceptional!More"}
{"review":"We've eaten at le Tobsil in Marrakesh, and this eating experience is right up there with the best.  The food is wonderful, but it's the ambience, the service and the presentations of the dishes that really stand out.  You can choose family style dishes, which...are massive, or as we did, just a bunch of appetizers and small dishes that we all shared.  Excellent.More"}
{"review":"The olives, the bastilla, the tartare, the short rib family style\u2026.wowowowow.  Every Ramakan and side dish oozes with flavor and taste.  It\u2019s a shame San Francisco is a dying city but this place is frickn fan frickin tactic.  It\u2019s a fairly easy reservation to get...too.  Far superior to Mozza in LA or other single star restaurants.    So here is what you order.  The tartar, the olives, the bastilla and the family style short ribs with Moro on sides.  You will be happy you didMore"}
{"review":"Incredible on every level.  The service is perfect.  Our server Lorrin anticipated our every need and coursed our complicated meal so well.  Since my partner was just having aps he had to figure out out to course with my ap and entree and he did...an outstanding job.   The lamb entre and Duck appetizer were so unusual and great blending of flavors they were spectacular.   And our Som Jose had a real challenge pairing our selections but he was so knowledgeable and patiently explained the rationale behind each wine option that we were really entranced.   We had such an wonderful experience and our only regret was that we didnt save room for desert.  Will be back for sure!More"}

{"review":"The hostess and host were very engaging.  We were seated by the hostess and she brought us the water we requested within minutes.  Very attentive staff across the board.  Sommelier very helpful in selecting a wine for our dinner orders.  The basteeya was one of...the best dishes I\u2019ve ever tasted.  The lamb and branzino were very flavorful and wonderfully presented.  An absolutely awesome experience.  Can\u2019t wait to return on our next visit to San Francisco.More"}
{"review":"The restaurant does justice to the Michelin star. Every dish has that additional touch that would make you want it even more. Enjoyed chicken and snapper. \n\nWe had a private room for 7 people. The service was good.\n\nAs can be expected, it's a bit...pricey but is worth it for a special occasion.More"}
{"review":"This is a favorite Italian restaurant for my wife and I. We have been coming since Vince (the Grandfather) was running the restaurant. It has been excellent under Derek, Kevin & Gina and now Vince (their cousin).

Keep it up and we\u2019ll keep coming back when we\u2019re in town.More"}

{"review":"Trattoria Contadina is among our favorite restaurants in San Francisco's North Beach neighborhood. We were there in late July to celebrate our 30th anniversary. The food, as usual, was outstanding and the service top-notch. The staff is super-attentive and will guide you if you're unsure...of what among their delicious dishes you might select. Thanks for another good memory!More"}
{"review":"Small local restaurant.  Takes reservations.  We waited only a short time for our table. Lovely selection of wines by the bottle. Gluten free options. We had a GF diavolo and regular pasta which was nice size and mildly spicy. Pesce picatta redfish with vegetables yummy...sauce and fresh veggies. Ravioli correnti looked boring but the person eating was very happy. We split the affogato and tiramisu (shareable piece). The food came out quickly.  Maybe a bit rushed. Overall good experience and I would go back.More"}
{"review":"Now I KNOW that young folks usually like restaurants which are loud and bustling, but tonight (a Thursday) folks were literally screaming to be heard all around us and after over 20 minutes of this it literally made me ill!  I asked our waiter to...box up our meals so I could go home and eat in peace, but instead he offered us a \"quieter\" (not much!) table downstairs.  My husband ordered the pork dish which was tasty enough, but the \"Pavorati pasta\" which I ordered was pathetically tasteless with almost nothing but rotini.  It purported to have chicken, onion, sundried tomatoes and zucchini in a CREAM sauce, but what showed up was a plate full of rotini with perhaps 2 tbsps. of watery, tasteless milk, about 5 slices of zucchini, 4 tiny bits of watery chicken, and 5 tiny bits of sun dried tomato.  I asked for extra cheese and extra pepper but it was still tasteless and so I DID have it boxed up, took it home and had to recreate the dish from scratch!  (My version was delicious!)  But needless-to-say, we will NOT be dining at Contadina ever again!!!More"}
{"review":"We ate here all the time when we lived in SF 25 years ago. We hadn\u2019t been back to SF or Trattoria Contandina again until now and it is just as quaint and delicious as we remember."}
{"review":"Celebrated my 40th birthday here and it was lovely! We ordered the aged prosciutto with burrata, caprese with burrata, gluten free pasta with clams, gluten free chicken Valdostana, and pork saltimboca. Everything was amazing. Our server described the menu in great detail so we knew...how to order well. The imported burrata was lucious with fresh tomatoes and incredible prosciutto. The chicken valdostana was my dish and it was incredible and they handled my gluten allergy beautifully.\n\nOur server was so attentive and brought us small glasses of Prosecco to toast my birthday, an extra glass of Chianti for me at the end of the night, a piece of tiramisu and then gelato when he remembered I was gluten free\u2014all complimentary. The extra touches were sweet and made the evening. We drove into the city to celebrate and will definitely return! It\u2019s a new favorite.More"}
{"review":"Very noisy, staff is running around.  The girl pouring the water was all over the table. The fish was dry, the rest of the food was ok. We expected more based on other reviews. As Europeans we didn\u2019t think this was excellent service. Too much,...too busy, too many different people at  our  table. No quiet diner.More"}
{"review":"Advised on booking special 60th birthday for my husband.   Wasn\u2019t looking for any freebie but was hoping for a nice greeting and a \u201chappy birthday\u201d greeting at least.  On arriving not even a normal welcome, literally here\u2019s your seat. \nI mentioned my phone was playing...up so couldn\u2019t use QR code. The irritated waiter gave us a stained paper version. I asked to see a wine list (by the glass) told that\u2019s not possible as they don\u2019t have. \nWe have eaten Italian food all over the world (numerous times in Italy). This is nothing like that! \nRubbery, tasteless pork. Fish that had so much garlic and vinegar on I couldn\u2019t eat. \nNobody checked all ok so paid bill and left. \nDon\u2019t bother booking this restaurant- not worth the money !More"}
{"review":"While we were walking through Russian Hill, we chatted with a local who suggested that if we wanted a great meal at a place you wouldn't find listed in travel guides, we should come here. So we took his advice. The food was excellent, and...the service (our waiter was named Milo) was outstanding. After we chatted briefly with our waiter and he learned we were visiting from Boston and what we had already done in San Francisco so far, he came by later with a great list of suggestions of places we might want to visit in town. The only reason I rated four stars instead of five was that it was quite hot in the restaurant even though it was cool outside - it seems this is because the restaurant is so small and the kitchen is so close to the seating. Also, because it's small, wait times for a table can be long. Overall a great experience though.More"}
{"review":"Had a reservation for 4 at 545 on a Sunday, a nice table was set up when we arrived.  The restaurant is quite small but very charming and I had a great view of the kitchen.   Our waiter did an excellent job along with the...assistant.  Drinks were served promptly along with our bruschetta appetizer and bread for the table.  I ordered the meatballs with pasta for my entree, I would highly recommend this dish, served with 3 meatballs - it was plenty of food!  I finished with the blackberry cabernet sorbet which was delicious!  A wonderful experience!More"}
{"review":"Second night  in San Francisco  and I found the best Italian  Restaurant  around. My wife and I oder a glass of  Chianti Classico and a chardonnay  to start with.  My wife ordered for an appetizer a Caprese which was awesome.  The tomatoes were so sweet...and the burrata was so delicate.  I ordered  glass in a spicy sausage sauce. For entr\u00e9es my wife ordered  homemade  gnocchis in a lite cream  sauce  and I ordered homemade  ravioli stuffed with beef in a wild mushroom sauce.  It was the  best ravioli ever. For dessert we shared a blackberry  Cabernet sorbet.  Again,  awesome.  Definitely go to this  restaurant if you love Italian food.More"}
{"review":"Contadina is a nice old-school Italian restaurant. Really took me back to the way Italian-American neighborhoods in NYC or Philly looked in the 70s and 80s. \n\nThe open kitchen concept gives the restaurant a certain intimacy. Wine selection was full of good value and the...service was excellent: friendly and attentive without being smothering or condescending. \n\nWe started with the meatballs (just like mamma used to make), burrata and bruschetta (way too much cheese). As a main course, I had the Veal Correnti (pictured) which was flavorful. \n\nAs those who have read my reviews have come to understand, I\u2019m definitely an Italian food snob and I\u2019m happy to say that Trattoria Contadina passes the test!More"}
{"review":"This is the worst Italian food I've ever eaten.  The noodles were chewy and gummy, and the sauce was thick and goopy. Flavor of the sauce was overpowering. Definitely far from authentic Italian. There are much better Italian restaurants in SF.  All\nof the Italian...restaurants I've eaten at in SF (at least 20) are better than this place. Beware of fake 5 star reviews.More"}
{"review":"We happened on this wonderful restaurant by wandering past and the welcoming atmosphere enticed us in, which I'm very glad it did. Despite being very busy the manager was very accommodating and after a short wait at the bar we were seated. The food and...wine selection were excellent and our meals one of the best Italian meals we've ever had. The waiters were all great and we would definitely have visited again if we'd  been in San Francisco longer.More"}
{"review":"So we went here for the outstanding reviews and thought it was fine BUT\u2026.found a big issue. The 2 waitstaff were friendly and hard working and juggled takeout orders along with all the tables\u2026it was a little chaotic but they managed but would have benefitted...from a third\u2026 unfortunately the place is really too small for 3 waitstaff. We have had great sushi at many places and this was very good indeed but not all is perfect here. The primary issue is the sushi is being prepared by a chef with bare hands, no gloves. We sat at the bar 2\u2019 from the chef and all food is being touched by bare fingers touching not only all the raw fish in the bar fridge in front of us and all the other ingredients for all the orders but also the sauce containers, take out containers, and the same wipe rag that is used to clean the prep area continuously after each order as well as clean the knife. There was a prep sink 2\u2019 from the chef but for the entire 2 hours we sat at the bar no hand was washed with either water or soap at any time even after the chef needed to bandage his finger. All sushi places we have frequented have exhibited ultra sanitary food prep practices but not here and for that reason alone would not go back.More"}
{"review":"We arrived for an early dinner as soon as they opened at 4:30pm as other reviews indicated that it fills fast. As we were quickly joined by two other parties, we were happy to have made that decision. We enjoyed the spicy tuna temaki (it...was so good, I ordered the chef's special temaki after) maguro nigiri, salmon, toro and maguro sashimi and the Lizzy roll (so delicious with thin sliced lemon on top).  We washed it down with the house hot sake. Everything was fresh and delicious. We are very particular about sushi\/sashimi and Akiko did not disappoint, certainly ranking with among the best sushi experiences. Highly recommend and will return the next time we're in San Francisco.More"}

{"review":"The food was out of this world, and the waitress's recommendations were spot-on, elevating my enjoyment to new heights.

The impeccable service added a touch of luxury to...the entire experience, leaving me thoroughly impressed and eager to return.More"}

{"review":"This is one of the best sushi restaurants I\u2019ve been to outside of Japan. The toro and hamachi belly melts in your mouth.  The udon noodles are the best I\u2019ve ever had.  And the broth is so rich and flavorful.  I will definitely dine here...again whenever I\u2019m back in SFO.  Highly recommend for people who like traditional sushi.More"}
{"review":"My mother and I were taking a short trip to San Fransisco, and just WOW. This place was such a hidden gem!!!! It's a very small restaurant so we weren't expecting something to special, but it was so delicious that we even came back two...days later for another dinner. I ordered the chicken udon soup, and all of the noodles were perfectly chewy, the broth steamy, the cooked veggies were so soft, and the chicken very tender. All of these components created a perfect soup; with aromatic flavors that weren't overloading. The only thing I have negative to say is that the portion was BIG. Though that isn't that bad for a negative piece :). My mom got the Lizzie roll and a miso soup, which she said were very delicious. \nWhen we came back a couple days later (because it was so good), we decided to opt for many smaller dishes. I ordered an avocado maki roll and pork gyosa, my mom took another Lizzie roll and the Hamachi roll; plus we shared a seaweed salad and the Japanese eggplant. Everything was so great and tasted so fresh, and I tried the Lizzie roll too, which was very good. That added lemon slice on top was such a great addition! Lastly we finished with the vanilla crepe cake, which was fluffy and sweet.\nOverall, the food was divine, and everyone was very attentive and the customer service was wonderful. They have so many options and this place really helped make our trip as good as it was!More"}
{"review":"So happy we found this one on trip advisor with great reviews.  Absolutely agree this sushi was delicious.  Only down side was having to wait a while even with a reservation but once you step inside you understand why\u2026 there are like 3 tables and...4 bar seats.  This is one tiny place and clearly popular for a good reason.More"}
{"review":"Horrible quality and the amount of food is a joke. Very over priced I\u2019ve never seen a chirasi bowl so poorly presented and only few fish over a lot of rice"}
{"review":"Great sushi, excellent service. Reservations are a must. The place has only four tables! \nMy only quibble is that the nigiri are small. I ordered the deluxe platter for $69 or so, and it was tiny, half-bite sized pieces."}
{"review":"Excellent food, nice atmosphere.  A bit up-market for a solo meal for me but I was craving sushi and I wasn\u2019t disappointed.  The quality and price were evenly matched and the service was attentive, especially for a solo meal.  A lot of times I\u2019ll get...less than attentive service when I\u2019m alone- the server thinking a tip at a solo table is 1\/2 the tip of a larger table but that wasn\u2019t the case.  I got impeccable, attentive service with my delicious food.  I\u2019ll definitely visit again with friends next time!More"}
{"review":"Located very near my hotel (Chancellor Hotel on Union Square), and checked this charming little establishment out for dinner. Loved the sushi and sashimi- very fresh and tasted amazing! Friendly servers too :)"}

{"review":"Met some friends for dinner in September and was seated upstairs where it was quite warm and loud.  Aside from that, the food was artful and delicious.  A Chef friend was working there, but was off that evening - that's how we heard about this...place.  It's close to Union Square on Bush St. over the tunnel, and it's one of the few restaurants in that area, post pandemic.  If you are in the area, give it try - you won't be disappointed.More"}
{"review":"Great spot! We have been trying to eat here for a while and for one reason or another havent had the pleasure. . . .wow we were impressed. Great food and service (kudos to our server Hanna was awesome!). We highly recommend this place. Only...negative is we sat upstairs near the balusters overlooking kitchen and I tend to be on warm side and was burning up (I even asked one of the waiters to open a window and let the cold\/cool SF air in. This isnt a criticism of the restaurant just reality of heat rising from kitchen and just wanted people to know. This of course didnt distract from our wonderful experience. We highly recommend and we had such a great dinner we came back for Sunday brunch which was great as well!More"}
{"review":"Everything was great - the food, the service, and the price.\n\nStarting with the staff, everyone was super friendly, attentive, and helpful, from the host, to our waiter, and the servers. Our waiter was insightful in pairing our wine with our entrees, and was generous...in offering us samples to make our decision.\n\nThe food comes in a pre-fixed menu, though you can add on additional hors d\u2019\u0153uvres. The carrot soup was refreshing and well balanced, the duck breast was tender and delicious, and the mount blanc had the perfect amount of nuttiness and sweetness. The waiter informed us that the portions wouldn\u2019t be huge, but I was satisfied with the amount of food, especially after ordering some bread for the table - we were satisfyingly full without feeling stuffed.\n\nOur booking was very last minute so we weren\u2019t able to dine indoors due to limited availability, but the inside looked charming and cozy. We were comfortable sitting outside with the space heaters.\n\nIt was $55 per person for a three course meal, which I found to be reasonable for the high quality, especially in San Francisco.\n\nI will definitely be back!More"}
{"review":"We booked this restaurant whilst staying in San Francisco for a few days. The website advertises \u201csmall plates\u201d which attracted us as I have a small appetite.  The first disappointment was that it was so noisy and the tables are so close together that it\u2019s...almost impossible to have a conversation.  On top of that the guy doing front of house seemed to only have one volume and that was full blast!  The woman working with him was not much better.  Menus were presented to us and we realised that they do not offer small plates but a set 3 course dinner at $55 .  They do not have a wine list unless you\u2019re happy to download it on your \u2018phone. Extortionate prices but we opted for 2 glasses of red @ $15 each.  The food was average! OK salad and very thin butternut squash soup followed by tough pork chops and tasteless potatoes and salmon served with gritty greens.  We chose to share the 2 puddings - a cake which any school student could accomplish in a cookery class and isle flotante. There were a couple of isles but nothing for them to float on.  Where was the cr\u00e8me anglaise? Very, very disappointing dinner.  I know that American restaurants demand gratuities regardless but their suggestions were 20%, 22% or 25%.  Outrageous!  The bill was nearly $200 for one of the most ordinary dinners we\u2019ve ever had.  There was absolutely nothing French about the meal at all.  Avoid!More"}
{"review":"Julie, chef and staff went out of their way to accommodate my party  of 21 for a Reunion. Julie was extremely friendly and professional in handling the details and she was flexible and made us feel like family. Our event was upstairs, it was intimate...and romantic and the decor was tasteful and arty.  \nWe were welcomed with an amuse bouche of toast and tapenade and hot fresh bread which was the precursor to a great three course meal.  \nMy entire party was blown away by the flavors of the meal. \nI personally had the roasted pepper soup, the duck breast entree and a warm comforting berry cobbler type concoction. \nThe roasted pepper soup was silky, satisfying and a good portion. \nThe Duck breast was perfectly cooked, with a farro salad , fig gastrique and stone fruit on the plate. I did miss a crispy element like the crispy duck skin, and it didn\u2019t  look very pretty but the flavors made up for it. \nI did try the King salmon with fennel Confit, saffron cream which was outstanding. I do love it when i cannot figure out what\u2019s in a dish but it tastes so amazing on the palate. \nSome of my party had pots de creme, which was luxurious, rich and quality milk chocolate - but the too big dollop of cream needed to not be there. \nThe wine list is very good. The staff happy and helpful and put up with the noisy boisterous group! Compared to some picture i had seen the plating did appear lacking some finesse, but i put it down to a large crowd. My party left satisfied, well taken care of and completely happy with the special meal. There are many places to choose from in SFO, but we feel we made an excellent choice in Bouche.More"}
{"review":"My cousin and I ate here for the first time. We were a bit early. But we were welcomed by the staff and even served water before we were seated. French music was already playing in the background. I loved the French accents. The place...is quite intimate. And we were seated upstairs. Some of the staff still wore masks which made me comfortable taking mine off. The food was delicious. I had the zucchini soup, sea bass and almond cake. I would definitely come back here again.More"}

{"review":"Fantastic first two courses, average pudding.  Problems with the service. Rather than write a negative review I have written to the restaurant as I think they were just too busy to attend to us. If it\u2019s not too busy  - excellent choice. But definitely sit...inside - you will get better attention. We would have preferred a 2 course option but loved the menu.More"}
{"review":"We had a great prix fixe dinner here. Wonderful tomato soup to start, followed by a perfectly cooked pork chop. The pasta dish was just a tad too al  dente and would have benefited from a bit more sauce. Wonderful flavors all around."}
{"review":"We enjoyed dinner last night at BOUCHE, a new restaurant for us.  We sat outside at a tippy little table with the propane heater keeping us comfortable. The service was cheerful and  prompt and the dinner was beyond good.  The staff clearly wanted customers to...be happy. The menu changes every two weeks or so.  Our starter was a fresh pea gazpacho that was excellent. It takes real skill to make something complicated seem simple and perfect.   We both had the ahi entree which was delicious too, perfectly cooked, seared on the outside and  rare on the inside.   The bread was the real thing, fresh and crunchy  with thick, rich butter,  \n not grocery store butter. Dessert was an almond panna cotta and  a puff pastry filled with strawberries and cream.    \n\nThe cooking skills, fresh ingredients and attentive service made for a delightful  anniversary dinner. We will return.  Our bouches were definitely amused.More"}

The food was fantastic including the \u201cadventurous\u201d blind appetizer. It was a pre-fix meal and the choices were great. We all ordered different...items and tasted everything. The high point of the dinner, however, was our waiter. He was fantastic and seemed to really enjoy his job!  We would be regulars just for him and have referred our local friends for not only the food but also the experience!More"}
{"review":"I got takeout and brought it to my hotel up the street. Salmon was barely cooked and mushy. One side dish was missing and the other one was cold and slimy. It had a good flavor though, and I was hungry so I ate a...few bites of it. Then I walked three blocks back down the street to the restaurant and asked them to please cook my salmon and heat up the one side dish. I didn't want to complain about the missing side dish because it was an eggplant item. I don't really like eggplant very much. So the cooks heated up my food and added some additional tasty slimy stuff to my plastic take-out box. Then I walked back to my hotel and ate my warmed-up food. The people at this restaurant are nice and friendly. And I appreciated that they heated my food. So I'm giving this restaurant three stars. I am gluten-free and was able to find something to eat. Which is no easy task. There is a pizza place nearby called Uncle Vito's. That's where my husband got his dinner. His pizza was really hot and I could smell it. It smelled so good. I was jealous of him!More"}

The \"misto\" included calamari, rock shrimp, fennel, other veggies, and (believe it or not) lemon and olives. I would skip the deep-fried lemon and olives. They were served...with a delicious spicy aioli. Then we had the Dungeness Crab Louie. Delicious, and as I said, bring your appetite, it was huge!More"}

{"review":"We landed at Joe\u2019s for a late lunch on a Wednesday afternoon, on the recommendation of TripAdvisor reviews. We were looking for a simple diner and we\u2019re surprised to find see white table linen and apron-dressed wait-staff fussing about a packed restaurant.  We almost walked...out thinking we\u2019d entered a posh place and our t-shirts and shorts might not fit in.  We decided to stay and we weren\u2019t disappointed.  The food and service was exceptional.  The prices were the same as we\u2019d been paying at any regular diner, but you got so much more.  The fact that it was packed on a Wednesday was testament to it being good.  Atmosphere was noisy, but it was welcoming and jovial.  It was lovely to see so many older folk enjoying a meal out.  We had a ball.  Thank you and well done on creating a fantastic place for one and all.More"}
{"review":"We wanted to have a good meal at a longstanding SF restaurant and landed here on a Sunday afternoon.  It was a treat to see they were serving Brunch.  The restaurant had that rich old school warm Italian feel to it with the red booths...and the white table clothes.  The staff from the hostesses to our servers were wonderful and took great care of us.\n\nWe ordered some cocktails (Seasonal Spritz - YUM), a Jumbo Prawn Cocktail to share along with our brunch entrees (crab cake Benedict was fantastic).  The MUST on the brunch menu are the Bombolini, I mean who can resist a fresh  jelly donut?  \n\nBetween the excellent service, our food and the all around vibe of this place we had a GREAT experience.  Next time I am in SF I am definitely stopping in for dinner, as the menu looks fantastic.More"}
{"review":"Nice atmosphere, though a bit too noisy when restaurants was full. Later in the evening you better enjoy the place.\n\nClassy \n\nRib eye was excellent\nNY steak too but spend an extra buck for the rib eye, it is worth it \nHome made Ravioli were...good, although it reached our table too cold \nSpaghetti with meatballs \nCarbonara was a miss : way too salty.\n\nsourdough bread basket : very good \n\nIt is not 100pct Italian, more American taste  adapted Italian food but the quality and execution is there. \n\nService is genuinely friendly, efficient and prefessional. It matches with the place \n\nOne could be afraid to eat there as it is so big but they are doing the things right in an organised mannerMore"}
{"review":"Simply the best food of our five day trip.\nThe place was so busy, it took us until our 5th and final night to get a table there.\nSo glad we finally managed it, as the experience was simply the best of the trip. From...the polite, friendly and helpful staff to the exceptional food, this was a meal that will last long in the memory.\nAll our dishes arrived in a timely manner, with each and every one a taste sensation. You know how good it is when you consider returning to San Fran just to eat at Original Joe's..... or Exceptional Joe's as we now know it!More"}
{"review":"We picked this place to celebrate our 40th Wedding Anniversary and it did not disappoint. I had the lasagna and it was pretty good. My wife tried the spicy rigatoni and said it was excellent. We got very large portions and had a friendly and...efficient server. The restaurant was noisy and busy and reservations are recommended.  I did a special earrings presentation to my wife and it brought down the house. To celebrate our anniversary, the restaurant presented us a sparkling complimentary dessert.More"}
{"review":"Really delicious dinner at Original\nJoes. We shared a bowl of delicious chowder to start and then Steak and Chicken for main course with proper vegetables!  Great sized portions (not too big) and lovely service. We were lucky, we hadn\u2019t booked but managed to snag...a table almost as soon as we arrived. There is usually a wait and can understand why! Book if you want a set time, but otherwise worth taking your chances!More"}
{"review":"What a disappointment.  We sat outside as it was a nice day.  We got served and ordered our meals, I had Eggs Bene which was ok, hubby had Brunch burrito which was also just ok.  Orange juice was one of the best we have tasted....Our server whose name I know but no need to name and shame, said he would come back with water etc.  Never saw him again.  We waited and finished our meal then waited some more then went inside, he was behind the bar talking to a fellow server, he saw us so came over and printed out the bill, left it on the counter and walked away.  Were really not sure what to do so we signed it and left.  Wow - he was rude.More"}
{"review":"We\u2019ve chose this place because of the good net reviews, we wanted a good pizza. Starters were ok but surprisingly spicy, pinsas garnished with cold stuff like picked up in the fridge a minute before, one of the 2 glasses of white wine - trouble.."}
{"review":"Crazy delicious! Their one-size Roman-style pizzas are large enough for two, and while there are a limited amount of curated types of pies, you can totally customize the Margherita... limited but lovely wine selection... charming staff!"}
{"review":"Fantastic Italian restaurant with amazing food, good wines and terrific and friendly service.  We liked it so much we went two nights in a row."}

{"review":"Booked Montesacro based on the reviews, but as we approached this little hole in the wall, we were not sure what to expect. Inside, it's a little piece of Italy. While we only sampled four things, I imagine the rest of the menu will not...disappoint regardless of what you order. We are vegetarians so we minused out the meats on these: We had the Margherita and the Centocelle Pinsas. A pinsa is essentially a pizza, made on excellent dough. We also had the Insalata di Cavolfiori and the Burrata e Acciughe for appetizers (this was too much for two people; we took home a box for later). All were excellent, and the service was top notch!More"}
{"review":"Really excellent. Nice interior, perfect staff and absolutely great food.\nI recommend this restaurant. It is amazing Italian food in San Francisco."}
{"review":"Do we were looking for a more formal Italian in San Francisco, and this place cropped up. What a great. The menu is quite small, but the food is splendid. Feast on the  artisan cheeses, relish the pinsa's (who knew vgedtnut honey would be the...ideal Linda topping), and  get thoroughly immersed in the carefully curated wine list. \nGo on, you'll thank us for it.More"}
{"review":"Restaurant is a bit hidden away in an alley but don\u2019t let that deceive you. The food is extremely good (we all had pizzas), and the staff is very friendly. The atmosphere and food are reminiscent of true Italian cuisine. Definitely a hidden gem within...SF! PS. Try the Pinsa el Pistacchio dessertMore"}
{"review":"I feel like I went to another restaurant on another planet when I see the reviews from people about this place.  It has a corporate feel and is very average.  Absolutely nothing to make them stand out food wise.  The pasta dishes tend to be...over salted and the portions are small.  Of course the dreaded 5% fake surcharges is added to every bill.More"}
{"review":"You are transported at this little interesting italian restaurante and gourmet pizza place. Worth it. Great wines too. Do not miss it, near soma."}
{"review":"This restaurant was highly recommended. The food and service were excellent. The neighborhood, however was horrifying. It is in the middle of the tenderloin district and very very unsafe. As we left to get into our Uber a man was urinating in front of the...restaurants open door . As much as we loves the food, we would never return nor would we recommend this to anyoneMore"}
{"review":"Excellent Food and atmosphere. The pinsa is delicious. The ambiance of the restaurant is unique. Staff are friendly and super efficient. The wine even at the lower cost end was excellent."}
{"review":"The decor and the food are truly exceptional. Someone was meticulous in selecting and placing the interior design. There is nothing negative I can say about the food. Tasty and beautifully presented. Highly recommend!"}
{"review":"The pasta with pomodoro and basilic wasn't a real pasta, the basilic wasn't so fresh and wasn't basilic. The staff was normal. It wasn't the real italian food. Sorry for that, but as italian I didn't find the Tuscany savour."}
{"review":"Our group was so warmly accommodated by the staff, and the dinner was as delicious as it was convivial. Waiters recommended appetizers of focaccia (superb), bruschetta, caprese. The fettuccine with mushrooms and sun dried tomatoes was divine, as was linguine with anchovies. Cannoli were crispy...with a rich ricotta filling. The evening was memorable for the attentive service and the traditional Italian dinner.More"}

Nadia gave us her card and we made reservations for the next night.  Nadia was there to greet us when we arrived with a big hug.  The atmosphere was warm and friendly.

Grilled fish was good and...the housemade pasta wonderful.\n\nThey also serve great tuscan wine by the glass!More"}
{"review":"My wife, my brother and I dined here on 8 April.  It was a last minute decision and luckily the restaurant was able to accommodate us because both the meal and the service were excellent.\n\nI was indecisive between ordering the fresh fish of the...day (sole) and the gnocchi.  Nadia (who was amazing from beginning to end) suggested having the sole but gave us the gnocchi as a side dish.  These are not bed fellows that instantly come to mind but I was so pleased that we were able to sample both dishes.as they were both delightful.  The sole was beautiful and I have no hesitation in saying the gnocchi was the best I have ever tasted.\n\nHad my wife and I not been leaving town the following day, we would have definitely booked dinner for the following night too.\n\nThank you Nadia.  Thank you Firenze by Night.\n\nPlease please dine here if you visit San Francisco.More"}
{"review":"All of our meals were exceptionally good.  They have won awards for their gnocchi, and I can see why.  It was not dense like most gnocchi I've had - it melts in your mouth.  I also had a chicken crepe dish that was delicious.  The...service was very good also.More"}

We walked in and were treated like family from the start. We had good conversation, and the...food wash FANTASTIC! I love when I find a family owned restaurant that exceeds my expectations and puts a big smile on my face. My wife had the cannelloni and I had the egg washed white fish with a, seemed like Marsala sauce, over the top. Do yourself a solid and check it out.More"}
{"review":"Lamb Saag was excellent and spicey. Garlic Naan was crispy. One large piece. Beef special was very good . Rice was large serving. Self order at register.

The menu offered many appetizing selections, which our waiter helped us narrow down to our tastes.  Everything was affordable, so we were able to...sample a handful of items without breaking the bank.  I highly recommend this restaurant.More"}

Authentic flavors and really great cuts of meat used in all of the dishes we tried.  Had curry, tikka...masala, and biryani which was a bit spicy for me but my son and husband loved it.  First time having cherry naan and it was wonderful.  Friendly staff and very quick service.More"}

{"review":"The food was absolutely fantastic.  Everything was perfectly seasoned and cooked.  The portions were excellent and the prices were more than fair.  A little off the beaten path from tourist destinations, but well worth a little extra walking.  If I lived around here, I would...be eating at Curry Leaf all the time.More"}

{"review":"When staying in Russian Hill, I decided to get take out and discovered wonderful Indian food a block and a half away.  My order was ready when they said it would be, and was packed to stay warm and tasty.\nI had the Paneer Tikka...Masala and Nan.  The portions were generous at a value price.  If I lived there, I would probably frequent this restaurant weekly.More"}
{"review":"Great little place with some really good food. not fancy but cheap and cheerful! Enjoyed our meal (take out)."}
{"review":"Not your typical Curry House but more like street food cooked and served in a caf\u00e9. Once you have found your table, you order our food at the counter, pick up your plate, knife and fork and wait for the food to be cooked. You...collect it at the counter and return to your table. Strange experience. That said the food was really good and tasty.More"}

{"review":"After exploring the city for the day, my friends and I realized we hadn't made reservations anywhere for dinner. We found a last minute reservation for this spot. From the street, it doesn't look like much, so I wasn't sure what to expect. As we...descended the stairs into the restaurant from street level, we were greeted with a super dark and SUPER packed restaurant. We were seated at one of the very first tables and were served immediately. EVERY single thing we ordered was delicious.\n\nWe got the chicken karaage, edemame, and then asked the waiter to bring us his all time favorite rolls or what he recommended off the specials board. I can't remember what he brought, but there wasn't a stinker among them. \n\nYOU MUST EAT HERE WHILE IN SF!More"}

After we were seated and provided recommendations for evening on menus  we did made our selection of salads. Sushi and sashimi as well couple rolls that gave comfort of know food.  We were seated at a bar where we can see amazing work of sushi chefs and how meticulous and perfect each set of food was made.  We start receiving our order will order they never was approached by us, it serve to us to taste every single bit of sashimi or fish  that melt in our mouth with every bite. Hostess was nice and pleasant to have discussion about food and learn more about Japanese cuisine. At the end of day we had pleasant dinner and evening with that group of people.

{"review":"When you go down to this basement place you will find a noisy place packed with fibers and winners. The food is OK at most, nothing to travel a long way to. Sushi was fresh but I've never encountered a sloppyer prepared one like it....Can't be a proper trad sushi chef making this. With a price tag of over $60 it should have been better. Come early to order on their iPad or stay hungry for 45min minimum. The place is packed. Not the place for a romantic date but for groupsMore"}

{"review":"My friend and I were in town for a conference. Having seen the excellent reviews for Pazzia, we chose to dine here. With a little help from the staff, I chose the salmon with the crudaiola sauce. The fish was cooked exactly to my liking...and the sauce was fresh and light. My friend thoroughly enjoyed her hearty portion of lasagna. We enviously eyed  someone else's tiramasu. We would absolutely come here again!! Thank you Pazzia!!More"}
{"review":"Nicely laid out restaurant. The service was fine and whilst the food was generally very good, some of the dishes didn't quite hit all the high spots for us. In particular, the Linguine alle Vongole included juicy clams but there was a slight metallic taste...evident. Also, the Tiramisu was good but we prefer ours with alcohol in the recipe.More"}
{"review":"The food was fresh, the ambiance was perfect and the service was wonderful.   Couldn't have asked for a better dining experience."}
{"review":"Really, really good pizza.  I had the diavola but others looked equally good.  And the benchmark tiramisu was excellent too."}

{"review":"Friendly, efficient service.  Decent breadth to the menu, from salads, to pasta, to secondi, to pizzas.  Started with the fried pizza dough with mozzarella and prosciutto for the table(coccoli).  On order of gnocchi al pesto, one of taglierini Verdi alla Pazzia, and one paprdelle bolognese...(me).  I was gonna get the lasagna, but the waiter suggested the bolognese.  It was good...but, i gotta be honest, I think my wife's is much better...shoulda had something else.  Everyone else loved theirs.  A nice spot to which I would definitely return.More"}

{"review":"I\u2019ve been to Italy several times, and while I\u2019m not typically a \u201cfoodie\u201d, a simple, yet flavorful pasta dish is so comforting and fulfilling.

We thoroughly enjoyed the homemade noodles in meat bolegnese sauce and veal Parmesan. I will be back to try other dishes!!More"}
{"review":"My wife and I found this little gem in Nov 2016 when we lasted visited SF.  It was so good that we went back again during our stay.  We will do the same thing this time during our visit.  It is such a friendly place....The owner and servers are such swell people.  Tonight my wife had chicken breast, mushrooms and Marsala sauce with broccoli and potatoes on the side.  She also ordered a side of saut\u00e9ed spinach. She said it was delicious. I started with a salad of greens, tomatoes, pine nuts, and olive oil and balsamic vinegar. It was really great.  For my main meal I had Pappardelle Bolognese = long wide pasta with beef ragu and fresh parmesan on top.  It was excellent and very tasty.  No dessert tonight as we were full.  Very nice portions and the prices are very reasonable.  If you have not been to this restaurant you are missing out on a superb Italian meal!More"}

{"review":"We came here because of the reviews and it was close to our hotel. It seats about 36 people and yet it was really loud. Not intimate at all. Food was ok. Linguine and clams had no garlic to speak of. That was an essential...ingredient I would think. Husband not happy with pizza. Soggy. He ate two pieces and that was it.More"}

Welcomed by the wonderful Sarah....wish someone could clone her she's a great attribute to the diner. When you go somewhere you go for...2 reasons.\n1.. The way you are served and how they look after you.\n2.. The food, never had a bad meal busy or quiet the food is always worth the trip from Plymouth now.\nYes there are many places to eat closer to where I stay. But really if I trust in the way I get my food why would I go anywhere else. Chips spot on as always. Burger always perfectly cooked and somewhere with fresh tasty salad.\nBun is really nice as they don't use cheap ones byg the taste so nice to have real food. \nwould really love you guys to do a build your own burger as I could create a real mountain of food.\nJust remember when you go they are not small servings true to it's name it brings the diner to the UK. See you all next month.what else can I say about the place I've not said before. I'd just go and enjoy it there.More"}

{"review":"During a recent visit to San Francisco, I was fortunate to find so many unique eateries located around the hotel (BEI)  where I was staying.  One of those awesome eateries I stumbled upon was Sam's Diner.  As soon as I entered the diner I was...very pleased with the structure of the facility.  The old fashion wood, the marble tables, and many movie photos on the wall.  I was then very pleased to notice that the Sam's Diner menu had plenty of food items to choose from.  I always love those places that offer a variety of foods to fit everyone's taste.  The diner was also very clean, the staff very friendly, and my breakfast, when it arrived, was very tasty.  Although the morning before my visit to Sam's I had dined in a smaller cafe.  I loved the design and breakfast from the cafe however, I am a person who appreciates space.  Sam's Diner definitely provided space for sitting, stretching out and relaxing before taking in a bite.  I am looking forward to my next visit to San Francisco, and Sam's Diner.More"}

{"review":"Early dinner here before Hamilton. Fish tacos were terrible, smelled bad, sent back. French dip cold including au jus. Teriyaki chicken was ok, nothing special. Kids liked the fries.\nLooks like they get good reviews, don\u2019t know what was going on the night we were...there.More"}
{"review":"Great patty melt hamburger with terrific fries. Attentive service. San Francisco prices. Highly recommend."}
{"review":"Its a diner.  It has decent diner food--my wife had Salmon, I had Meatloaf, my daughter had Mac 'N Cheese.  All happy with our options.  Beer and wine.  Decent prices.  A short walk from the theater.  Signed posters from previous shows on the walls, and...we sat at a table adjacent to a cast member of the show.  Service was quick.  Can't think of anything to complain about.  Will be back.More"}
{"review":"Great food and great service. We got Korean tacos, chicken burrito, Pinot noir and decaf. All were great. Service was super quick and nice. In and out in 45 or so minutes. Reasonably priced. Super close to Orpheum Theatre for those grabbing a show. Highly...recommend!More"}
{"review":"Rolled up on Sam's late evening on arrival in SanFran.  It was right across the street from our hotel.  Their menu is varied enough that everyone could get something they liked.  The club sandwich was fresh, hot, & delicious.  French fries were typical fast food...fries but good.  Our wait staff was friendly and got our order out quickly.  \nWe will be repeat customers on our next visit.More"}
{"review":"We had the combination salad, oysters, and the sashimi. Super fresh and great service. However, they can keep the place a bit more cleaner, they  filled the coffee cup and it spilled all over the saucer. But overall would go there again."}
{"review":"Very unique place to eat. We arrived at 2PM and although they close at 2:30 they welcomed us in. Delicious sea food I recommend!!"}
{"review":"Awesome - back for a second time in 3 months. Best and freshest seafood ever tasted. Going back next time in town."}
{"review":"Excellent fresh seafood at reasonable prices.Few sides. People just eat  the seafood . The place seats only about 20 people and offers counter service only, by very attentive servers (all male). Expect to wait in line 30-60 minutes to get a seat. Worth the wait,"}
{"review":"Saw it on a food blog long before trip, put on the list. \nSmall, basic but great food and service, lovely atmosphere. \nCan get very busy with queue down the street, best to get there early and have clam chowder and beer for breakfast! Followed...by crab Louis salad. \nSuperb. Went twice.More"}
{"review":"Having read the reviews  we decided to visit this place.\n\nWe went around 9.30am and managed to get seated at the bar.\n\nWe started with a cup of clam chowder which I found to have very little seafood in it.\n\nWe then had the sashimi...which was salmon, tuna, halibut and scallops in a caper dressing which was nice and fresh.\n\nWe then ordered the half cracked crab which at $25 wasn't worth it as there was very little crab meat.\n\nNot somewhere I would rush back to.More"}
{"review":"Awesome dining experience. Narrow bar seating, shoulders to shoulders. Great history behind this establishment. Everything is fresh and well explained by our server Brian. Well done."}
{"review":"My husband and I visited here while in San Francisco and really enjoyed eating at the Swan Oyster Depot. The place has an amazing vibe and the food, particularly the crab and shrimp, is amazing! Expect to queue, but worth the wait!"}
{"review":"Service was prompt and nice. Food was fresh and good but expensive. BUT we waited about 2 hours for a seat. In our opinion not worth it. You can only pay cash which was quite a problem for us so we had to limit what...we order. There are only a few dishes on the menu (which is not a problem but just as information). \nAll in all a good place to eat when you dont\u2018t have to wait that long. If there is a long queue we would not wait again for so long.More"}
{"review":"Based on reviews and constantly seeing the queues over the years decided to take the plunge. \nOpens about 1000\/1030 so I would suggest to start queuing at 0930. I queued at 1025 and got in about 11:15 so take awhile and as they close at...15:00 approximately there is no point getting there past twelve.\nStaff were lovely and friendly and they don\u2019t rush you and made a couple of suggestions.\nI waited until I got a seat at the counter which is great as you can see everything going on.\nGreat atmosphere and the chowder and sourdough was delicious.More"}
{"review":"Arrived at 1:15pm in the queue , waited until 2pm before anyone came up to us and said that they stop seating at 2pm and we could only take away considering that the queue was pretty small when we arrived it was a bit of...a shock. The place inside is fairly small and cramped. People rushing around and can barely hear the staff when ordering. We all order a variety of things to take away and was all pretty disappointed not only with the flavour but also the wait considering they weren't doing anything to most of the orders. Clam chowder was okay, crab cocktail was just a pot of u seasoned crab with not even a slice of lemon to go with it and the sans for the oysters. Would recommend saving your time and going somewhere else. Whilst I appreciate it's notorious and has a authentic system it runs on, its not worth the wait.More"}
{"review":"Got in line at Noon, and waited Patiently for one of the few Counter Seats available. The place is small, so I expected to wait, but after the line budged a little bit, the wait seemed to get longer! We saw a few employees walk...out and the man in front of me, who\u2019s apparently a local, said, \u201c the employees must be leaving to go Drink at the bar down the street!\u201d, with a chuckle. Apparently the employees do this a lot! My GF and I were finally sat 2 hours later, and the employees behind the counter seemed disorganized, and had bad attitudes. We put in our order for a Dozen Oysters, Crab Cocktail, and 2 Clam Chowders. For what it\u2019s worth, the food was just MEDIOCRE \u2026.expect the same quality as touristy Fisherman\u2019s Warf. On top of that, the employees do not use gloves when preparing your food, while also touching money. Gross! So if you like to wait in long lines to be served mediocre food with a bad attitude, This is The Place for You! \ud83d\udc4eMore"}
{"review":"Eat here! Usually a line waiting to dine,  but go early and grab a table curbside. There are a few spots inside at the counter, which is great to see the fish\/oyster\/salad\/chowdah action. The staff is delightful and you might think you are in Boston....Fish is very fresh. Chowder is chowder-y and beer is cold. Smoked salmon plate is a must. Oysters, of course!\nNote to diners: This is a cash only establishment.More"}
{"review":"Tried to beat the line but still waited over an hour, and it was absolutely worth the wait. Delicious and good selection of oysters. The soft shelled crab might have been the best I\u2019ve ever had. The off the menu items are the best options....Don\u2019t miss out on the Sashimi! The waiters were great and good vibes all around. Definitely my best meal during my visit.More"}

{"review":"The location and atmosphere of this place is really nice, and the service is excellent. While we liked the food, it didn't really have that wow factor that I hope for when finding new places."}
{"review":"I\u2019m not a huge fan of tapas style restaurants, but man, this place has made me change my mind.  \n\nThis place boasts great cocktails, good food, over the top service (kudos to Juliana), and a pretty cool ambiance.  Whether a date night, family night or...group outing (there was a party of 20+ when we arrived), it\u2019s a good fit for anyone\u2019s needs. \n\nJuliana was our server, and she was delightful, friendly, and super attentive; her team made sure there was never a dirty plate on the table.  She helped us make some decisions when ordering and we were happy with ALL the items that landed in our tummies.  \n\nI would totally come back. \n\nNote \u2013 restaurant is at the pier so parking can be a challenge; just take an uber.More"}

The view of the Bay and the Bridge is great.  There is a cool outdoor...bar as well.   The food and ambiance were wonderful!   Like any good tapas restaurant,  you need to try lots of different entrees together.  One hearty recommendation is the Black Paella---it was terrific and easily fed 4 people.More"}

{"review":"FOOD ALLERGY NEGLIGENCE: DO NOT VISIT THIS RESTAURANT IF YOU HAVE FOOD ALLERGIES.\n\nI have a serious egg allergy and explicitly stated this to the waiter who served the table. I asked if the homemade date ice cream had egg, they said no. I asked...that he double check with the kitchen,  still declined this had egg. I trusted and place an order, lucky for me, my throat closed up immediately after. Either the waiter deliberately lied to me, or the kitchen did not care enough to take the allergy seriously.\n\nI've contacted higher up numbers of times with no follow up. The manager Christopher Rivera has promised to call me 3 times now with no follow up. All I've heard back from the higher up is that \"they take food allergies very seriously\" - so if this is correct, can you explain why I almost got admitted to the hospital and threw up in the Uber on my way home with no follow up from the team ?More"}
{"review":"Lovely Spanish food in a buzzy large room. We sat on high banquettes against one of the walls so could watch the action in the restaurant. We shared a meat platter, croquettes, squid and paella. Every thing was very tasty but the portions fairly small...so I could have ordered more.More"}
{"review":"Gourmet!\n\nPatas Bravas cooked over wood fire are smokey and beyond beyond.  The grilled octopus also is cooked on the woodfired grill and has to be experienced, can't be described. The eggplant sandwiches are another experience.  The lamb meatballs are also great.\n\nThe service is...a bit wacky.  They apparently lost the order of one of the dishes, whereas a different order we had placed showed up in 30 seconds (probably ordered by another table?).  This was rectified by the missing order being delivered and comped.More"}
{"review":"Cold yet sunny day to enjoy their bayside patio. Service was impeccable - friendly, knowledgeable, efficient. We started with a beer and sangria - my husband immediately regretted not ordering this tasty, not too sweet sangria with it's whimsical rosemary sprig. Three heads-on prawns soothed...his soul: sweet & tender with a not spicy chile sauce, which he soaked up with the wood fired toast. Crispy battered tiny purple and white creamy potatoes were served with smoky paprika sauce. yum. The ultimate taste experience arrived in the Bocadillo - sweet toasted brioche with cheese & eggplant & honey- I can't even begin to describe the amazement my mouth felt! We would 100% go again on our next SF visit.More"}
{"review":"We, and DOZENS OF OTHERS, had reservations through Open Table at this place during the week between Christmas and New Year's.  All of us showed up to find the place CLOSED.  A note on the door said \"Closed for the holidays.\"  So, why were they...taking reservations?  HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE.  We'll never even think of this place again and we'll tell as many San Francisco travelers of this experience and to avoid this waste of time at all costs.More"}
{"review":"This was my first time eating here. I had a reservation so I was quickly seated. The place was busy with a lunch time crowd. My waiter was not quite attentive, but I guess he was busy. I had the Pappardelle for lunch. I loved...it. The pasta had the perfect firmness.More"}

{"review":"My friend and I had lunch here recently during quick trip to SF. Wait staff was very attentive and friendly but not overbearing. The burrata salad was amazing and we also loved the hearts of romaine salad. Our favorite pasta was the pappardelle with short...rib ragu. We also had the pesto but wished it had a bit more flavor. Would definitely recommend this restaurant and would go there again if I am ever back in town.More"}
{"review":"Place is completely full. For some reason everyone accepts mediocre Italian. I don\u2019t get it. My wife whips up a better pasta in ten minutes than these people do. The bread is so hard you could cause serious damage if you started a throwing match....The halibut came our RAW (see picture). And the waiters are disrespectful by wearing there masks on their chin. Also at the table. And continuously playing\/touching their mask. Like a crazy habit. Not covering your nose and mouth, and then continuously touching your dirty mask. Get everyone the same mask and make them wear it or not serve. We are still in a pandemic, and there are people that can still not get vaccinated (either because of their age or something else). But I don\u2019t get why people go here. Mediocre at best. Really. The manager was very correct. He wanted to get me something else instead of the halibut (see picture); but after that, I was done.More"}
{"review":"We were in town for our anniversary and really had trouble finding top restaurants that had reopened after Covid.  Perbacco had availability and we made our reservations, noting that it was our anniversary.  We arrived about 20 minutes early for our reservation, but they were...able to seat us right away.  The hostess noted it was our annivesary and thanked us for celebrating with them.  The menu was not huge, but that was okay so as to make it easier to decide on a choice.  Wife had one of the pasta dishes which was delicious.  I had the short ribs over corn polenta and found it outstanding.  Great advice on an Italian wine to go with it and finished with a nice pair of meringue cookies filled with hazelnuts, as well as the pair of cheeses and chocolate desert we ordered.  We've been eating out quite a bit lately and restaurants are really struggling getting their service back up to pre-pandemic levels.  Not Perbacco, they did a great job and should you visit, you won't regret it.More"}
{"review":"This was spectacular. Recommend. We are halibut, short ribs, orcchiette, and apricot torte desert. Delicious!"}
{"review":"We keep coming back to this well known eatery.  This was our third time in probably three years (excluding 2020 for obvious reasons).  Still in the late pandemic period, we chose here again.  This time we dined outside on the sidewalk, even though they had...just opened up inside for limited seating.  We were apprehensive at first due to the uncertain SF weather and the unpredictable pedestrian\/vehicle traffic noise.  We're pleased to say our worse fears were not experienced; maybe a little cold, but they do provide very nice heaters.\n\nThis time, we chose to order the Florentine Tomato Soup (fantastic taste), and Market Salad w\/ mixed seasonal veggies and lettuce as starters.  The white balsamic vinaigrette dressing on the salad was perfect!  My soup had to be one of the best warm tomato soups ever.  Too bad it's \"seasonal\".  My wife also ordered a glass of Peter Paul chardonnay (one of the best chards one can enjoy).  \n\nFor our main courses we ordered the Short Ribs w\/ sweet corn polenta, Halibut w\/ braised potatoes, along with sides of Snap Pea salad and pan roasted cauliflower.  Again, the short ribs were wonderfully moist and the Halibut was one of the best.  \n\nFor dessert, we ordered the Panna Cotta to go.  By this time, it was a bit too chilly and windy,  \n\nWe left very pleased with our first venture out in 2021.  You can rest assured that dining here is safe, inside or out depending on your personal level of comfort.  The food continues to be superb.  Our server, Benjamin, was also outstanding.More"}
{"review":"While coming here for the first time with a big client who frequents the establishment often, I was very excited to try this very fine restaurant. While the owner was very friendly and welcomed us both in English and Italian we were off to a...good start. Unfortunately, the server we had was very nice but his attentiveness was not so good and the fact he made two mistakes to my order was disappointing, especially since the requests were clearly discussed and the waiter even made comments like \" a very nice choice, I will get that for you\".  Forgetting to switch the veggies for the potatoes in the Halibut order is acceptable, but then when we clearly said we would like to get some green veggies, like Brussel Sprouts with our meals, and him saying, yes, that is a great idea, i will get that for you, and then not getting it, was just not right. So after mentioning Veggies 4 or 5 times, and never getting one Vegetable definitely shows a lack of oversight or care. Being a new customer, I did not raise the issues in front of my client,  and I continued to order cheese and more wine for desert, so overall, our meal ended up ok. I know this place can do much better, so hopefully it is an isolated person.More"}
{"review":"Visited this restaurant during COVID. Recommended by our hotel.  It\u2019s a long walk from Union Square but manageable.  Cozy restaurant. Full bar.  Decent wine list.  Good menu selection.  Ordered the spicy almonds, great taste, not too spicy. Husband had the soup of the day (mushroom)....i had the pear salad   Both delicious.  (Husband ate 1\/2 of my salad, he says that & his soup could have been his dinner!).  The papardelle w short rib was perfect!  Small serving was the perfect size for me.  Husband had the full size, perfect for him   Added the Brussels sprouts as a side.     Wait staff was very attentive. Fabulous dessert menu too.  Definitely would recommend this place for dinner!More"}
{"review":"Dined at Perbacco for the first time last evening. Much to our dismay, a couple in the main dining room conducted Zoom and telephone calls with the cellphone speaker on full volume. Several of the tables asked the waiter and manager to intervene which they...were reluctant to do until the situation devolved into an argument between the table. The restaurant needs to implement a no cellphone speaker use while dining and should have moved the couple to a more isolated area of the restaurant or asked them to leave. The inaction on the part of restaurant when asked resulted in an unpleasant dining experience. I would not recommend dining here until this issue is resolved.More"}
{"review":"We walked in for lunch because it looked elegant.  That's one of only two things good I have to say about it.  There was no lunch menu; we were handed a dinner menu with dinner menu dishes and dinner menu fine dining prices.  I had...the \"minestra\" soup which was described as bean based, but it was so intensely flavored up with herbs and spices that the bean flavor was buried.  My wife had a pizza.  It was listed on the menu as Margherita but none of the characteristics I associate with that name: no mozzarella balls, no fresh tomatoes.  It was nothing but an everyday plain pizza with no toppings.  What saved my rating as average instead of poor (the second good thing) was a spectacular Caprese salad that had delicious mozzarella and flavorful tomatoes.   Service was courteous, decor pleasant.More"}

We spent two weeks in Italy this summer and the dinner we had at Poggio was as authentic as the small trattorias in Milan and Venice. The service was impeccable, Bart gave great recommendations and was...the type of server I wish we had at every restaurant. The veal appetizers, the squash appetizer - sublime. The gnudi - similar to gnocchi but much lighter with a short rib ragu was the best meal I\u2019ve had in years. Wonderful atmosphere to boot.More"}

{"review":"Haven't been here in years and grateful they are still serving up great food.\nTook friends here to celebrate their Birthdays.\nWe were seated right away, outside, under the covered parklet.\nThough the table was \"quite wobbly\", we seemed to manage.\nNatch we ordered the...Millionaires Bacon Combo plate. OMG, can we say \"finger licking good\"!  Though we asked this be delivered w\/our meal, it came a good 15 min. early :-(\nRemember, I mentioned the table was really wobbly. Well the gal who brought the bacon platter kind of threw it on the table, knocking 2 of the 3 coffee cups and spilling coffee everywhere. As she skittered away we were just able to ask for a rag or something to clean it up. She breezed over and then threw more napkins on the table. We all eye rolled at that point ~ Rude!\nOur server Magnum was very nice and attentive just enough.\n\nWe ordered the following:\nRicotta Hotcakes - super light, super fluffy, super yummy! Albeit it a wee bit skimpy and small.\nAthenian Omelet - wonderfully cooked, light, fluffy and very flavorful\nFrisco Benedict - Hm, it was good, but not very hot. Actually none of our food was very hot. Always a huge disappointment. My poached eggs were over hard, which I did not expect. The toast (huge thick slab, which I don't think was Ciabatta as advertised) was impossible to cut through and the wobbly table didn't help. I ended up pulling everything off this slab and eating it separately. Again, bummer. But the Chicken Mango Sausage was outstanding and the avocados perfectly ripe and plentiful.\n\nWe all thought the Rainbow potatoes were really pretty but they were all soggy, flavorless and not crisp. More like leftover potatoes from the previous day, I don't know. Most of the potatoes we left on our plate.\n\nOf course none of this was cheap, heck, nothings cheap anymore.\nBut for gawds sake, if you are going to charge this much and $4.00 for a mediocre cup of coffee, step up your game and get better coffee. More like brown water, really and again, not hot.\n\nDon't think I will be back for breakfast but choose lunch instead.More"}

They were cooked differently this year and while good, not the same as the ones we had prior. Restaurant can be a bit loud as tables are quite close to each other. Definitely make a reservation if going over the weekend.More"}
{"review":"Although it is on the price high end the service is fast the food is tasty and nice setting. My Benedict eggs were Perfect And the cappuccino as well."}
{"review":"I spontaneously stopped by for Sunday brunch and there was a line waiting to get in. While I thought I might have to wait a long time, the hostess and rest of the staff, did a good job working the line and getting people in...efficiently. The service only got better once I was seated. The food was excellent and the service was outstanding. I will eat here again the next time I'm in San Francisco.More"}
{"review":"We dined here based on a local's advice and were overall pleased even though the service was not top notch.  Our waitress seemed to be in a rush, didn't catch that the food delivered was not as ordered, slow to bring our bill, etc. Another...person that I assume was the manager seemed to sense our frustration and stepped in to check on us at the end.  The food was good overall and worth another visit the next time we visit San Francisco.More"}
{"review":"Visited on recommendation from our B&B\nVery nice neighborhood ambiance \nBloody Mary -awesome\nMillionaire bacon Benedict =the top 2of any I've had ( and I've had lots)\nThis place ROCKS-do yourself a favor and go!\nReserve or long wait (worth it)"}
{"review":"Born and lifelong San Franciscan, I recently discovered City View Restaurant when it was recommended.\n\nOur party of three went for Dim Sum on a Thursday at 11 a.m. We had BBQ Pork Buns (new style), Peking Duck with buns, Crab Claw, Walnut Shrimp, Shrimp...Dumplings, and Custard Buns.\n\nI loved the ambiance and interior.\n\nThe service was great and dishes came out readily.\n\n- New Style BBQ Pork Buns. This is the only place I know that has new-style BBQ Bork Buns. It was my first time having this, and I love them! The dough is more of a biscuit than the steamed buns and baked BBQ Buns (I love all three different types of buns and eat them based on what I'm longing for). They're filled with delicious BBQ meat.\n\n- Peking Duck. A must!\n\n- Crab Claw. A must! A real piece of crab wrapped in a thick crab mixture with a fried exterior.\n\n- Walnut Shrimp. A must!\n\n- Shrimp Dumplings - delicious, but they're just as delicious at other Dim Sum restaurants.\n\n- The Custard Buns are a sweet dessert filled with creamy sweet custard vs. the solid custard of other Custard Buns I've had before.\n\nI plan on taking my family and friends to this and will plan to order all the same stuff (except shrimp dumplings, though delicious, can be had at other Dim Sum restaurants), plus try more new stuff!\n\nSorry, no pics. I only thought about reviewing and taking pics AFTER we gobbled it all!More"}
{"review":"I used to come to City View a lot when it was at Commercial Alley.  I really liked bringing friends and family here who were visiting.  The space was bright, large tables, you could really enjoy the ambiance with the many carts filled with dim...sum rolling by.  The food was spot on, and, they validated parking!  \n\nWe brought a visiting family member from Argentina here recently and it was beyond disappointing.  Although we were seated immediately, the new space is much darker and kind of depressing.  Also, the format now is more that you order off of a menu rather than grab something from the rolling carts.  They still have the carts, but they are far and few between.  Most of the foods is ordered off the menu, and it takes FOREVER....we waited almost 20 minutes for sesame balls...other dim sum, e.g. shrimp and chive dim sum, was actually burned on the bottom, so the quality took a nose dive.  They also would cut some of the dim sum items, like the Taro balls and sesame balls in two, automatically.  Now you have to ask!  Other items also took a long time to arrive and the restaurant was not anywhere as busy as it was when it was on Commercial Alley.  \n\nLastly, trying to get someone's attention to get the bill and then actually having them ring you up and bring back the receipt, after you've given them your card,  took fooooorever.  For this person, the magic that was with City View is now gone IMHO.More"}
{"review":"We have been fans of City View for years. We would make special trips into San Francisco just for their prized Dim Sum. This trip, we discovered that they've moved closer in to Chinatown and into a refurbished building. Instead of waiting for a table...in an open room, we were escorted to a booth. Surprise, surprise, there were no carts roaming around to choose our meal from. Instead we were handed a fancy picture menu from which we ere to order.\nFood quality was still good but the lack of ambience really made our trip from Montana a huge disappointment. The lack of tablecloths and the roving carts left us with the feeling that they no longer catered to the local Chinese and business community, but now focused on tourist trade who may or may not have a sense of what the whole dim sum experience is supposed to be.\nlastly, apparently their new address hasn't shown up on local cab GPS's. Lots of luck finding the place.More"}
{"review":"The quality of yum cha \/ dim sim were good. Examples are the filling of the siu mai, and the pastry skins of the dumplings being quite thin. However, selection is very limited, especially on desserts, examples are lack of sesame rolls and coconut pudding."}
{"review":"We\u2019ve had many different dim sum: they were all in best quality. Also the buns and the desserts. Fast and efficient service, attentive staff- what else can one wish for?"}
{"review":"Great food and great service. Enjoyed very much. The ambiance was a bit plain, but the location was good. Walking distance to interesting sights."}
{"review":"This is a very good Chinese restaurant. Decor is very nice. Service is very good. It is dim sum style. No more carts being pulled around, but you order at your table and they bring each order to your table when it is ready.  Egg...rolls, spinach bun, lava custard, and sesame chicken were very good, as was a red bean paste bun. Service was very good and prices were pretty good. Definitely recommend.More"}
{"review":"Outstanding Dim Sum with larger than usual shrimp dumplings and shrimp with chive. I liked spinach steamed dumplings,  my partner thought they were just ok. Sticky rice was tasty but small portion. Turnip cake was tender. Loved it. We will be back. \nIt's in the...middle of the block, look up to see sign. Can't see inside. A bit confusing.More"}
{"review":"Drat.  The old City View dim place on Commercial St was once a great business dim sum place that relatives used for events.  They moved (ok, that happens) and just opened in the new place on the street above the Chinatown Parking Garage.\n\nHad high...hopes--they were sort of dashed.  Maybe they are trying to get their feet under them still with the move and re-opening?  Ha Gow shrimp dumplings had wrappers that were too thick, not see-thru, and the shrimp tasted over-steamed.  The Siu Mai pork dumplings tasted as if they had been on the steam table since the morning rather than made and steamed just then--the greens had a sauce that was over salty--and the Ha Cheung (long wrapped shrimp) was in a  wrapper far too thick and not spiced quite right.  \n\nThis used to be a place that the family and friends used as a third place for celebrations and lunches--but--it's going to need to improve to get that status back.More"}
{"review":"One of my favorite dim sum restaurants in San Francisco.  The servers push carts with dim sum around the restaurant and you can point out what you want.  The restaurant is large, so there is hardly a wait.  Easy parking located across the street."}
{"review":"The best dim sum in SF.  The quality is really excellent.  Fresh moist seafood make the shrimp dumplings fantastic and the best pork in the pork buns are a real treat as well.  We loved the sui mai and save room for the delicious custard...treats at the end.\nThe staff and owner are friendly and helpful and we follow them to their new digs in Chinatown.More"}
{"review":"While I moan about the disappearance of dim sum carts, Having slightly fresher food from the kitchen, rather than touring long distances around the dining room before it gets to you. Service is quick and we\u2019ll done. Except they quoted a 20 minute wait for...XO noodles.\nI really liked the shrimp dumplings. Every thing else was good. Four stars. We will returnMore"}
{"review":"We visited this highly rated restaurant for dim sum and it exceeded all expectations.  Don\u2019t overlook the shrimp dumplings or the crab \u2026 delicious and chock full of fresh seafood."}

{"review":"We came here on a Sunday for traditional Dim Sum and were not disappointed! It was absolutely the best dim sum we have ever had. I'd recommend getting in line early. We arrived 20 minutes before opening and were  about 25th in line."}
{"review":"We each had the same dish here and it was astoundingly good: the Pasta Diplomatica.  All of the ingredients were fresh, flavorful, perfectly cooked.  The sauce was delicious.  We live in Boston so we know seafood, and this was as good as I've ever had...in my 79 years.  Good Old Fashioned cocktail, good service, nice water view.  Fine dining prices but well worth it.More"}

{"review":"Wonderful restaurant on the water in Fisherman's wharf.  Very old family owned. Wide variety of delicious seafood"}
{"review":"Food was good - my wife had shrimp pasta and I had fish and chips. A bit pricey for what we got but it was good. I\u2019d recommend this place for a good seafood meal at fisherman\u2019s wharf."}
{"review":"I come from a city in Australia which is renowned for the best fresh seafood locally so I tend to judge seafood restaurants quite harshly.  I have had seafood in several states in the USA but I must say that Scoma's knocked it out of...the park.  The best clam chowder,  my wife's crab \ud83e\udd80 salad was deluxe and loaded with crab. My dish of 3 types of fresh fish and shrimp that was recommended by the waiter was excellent.  The service was the best, well done.  Highly recommended.More"}
{"review":"The walk out the pier to Scoma's is rustic and provides real working waterfront views of fishing vessels docked there.  The restaurant exudes 1970s atmosphere but is super clean, nothing worn anywhere.  There is a great view of the city with the working waterfront in...the foreground.  Oh, and the food, service, drinks and wine are all excellent!More"}
{"review":"Well, I knew I was booking a restaurant on Fisherman's Wharf and was hoping that the great reviews and history of this location would trump the 'tourist trap' location.  I'm sad to report that it did not.  We arrived for our reservation and were greeted...by a young woman who seemed to be doing her best Wednesday Addams impression --- no smile, welcome, or anything other than seeming annoyed that we had arrived.  Someone else showed us to our table, which was in the back section of the restaurant adjacent to a closed bar.  No tablecloths on the tables in this area (as there were in the main dining room), no atmosphere, no view.  We felt like we were sent to the 'kids table'.  Our table was so tight to our neighbours that we ended up knowing and chatting with them as anything else seemed rude, given the proximity.  I ordered the world famous clam chowder and it had sand in it.  I know clams can be tough to clean, but it's still a big miss and if it's your signature dish, it should be done correctly.  My shrimp and scallops were fine, but not anything great and my husband's halibut wasn't properly seared.  On a positive note, the service was outstanding and this is clearly a restaurant that values old school service principles.  We wouldn't go again or recommend to visitors to the area.  Perhaps they save the tablecloth front of house for regulars or those from whom they want repeat business.More"}
{"review":"We were recommended this place on various online groups for our visit to SF and it did not disappoint. \n\nService was quick and our waiter was attentive. \n\nI ordered the chowder and wow! The best I\u2019ve ever had. \n\nHighly recommend"}

{"review":"WORST RECEPTIONIST\/ LADY WHO ALLOCATES SEATINGS! TERRIBLE SERVICE! RUDE MANAGER! I have been going to Bar Bocee for almost 7 years now. This was the first time when my parents were visiting, I brought them to have a good experience with a great view. The...\"view\" is closed, so you can't go to the beach directly, which was a letdown to begin with. We could have found great restaurants near the main market in Sausalito, but I asked my parents to walk 15 minutes in the scorching heat (80 degrees) just to experience Bar Bocee. The lady who was allocating the seating was extremely rude from the start. I asked her not to give high-seating chairs to my older parents, but she still did. Then, when I requested to change, she moved us in front of the bathroom. When I asked to leave and wanted to at least click a picture of my father there for an experience we visited, she rudely sent her manager to tell us that we were clicking \"her\" photo. I was astounded by her unprofessional behavior and false blame. I have traveled to 40+ countries and have had dining experiences in some of the finest restaurants; I am also an SF local. Therefore I can say, please avoid visiting this place at all costs, unless the staff is changed in the future.More"}

{"review":"We shared the kale salad along with the butternut squash and pesto chicken pizzas!  Delicious!!!  The view was lovely as well!"}
{"review":"My girlfriend is allergic to tree nuts and we specifically multiple times ordered food without nuts. When our meal arrived we began eating and I noticed that there were nuts mixed in. The kitchen had a complete disregard for the note about no nuts and...my girlfriend began to experience allergic reaction. Luckily we were prepared with her epi pen and Benadryl but night ruined. Highly do not recommend this place solely because of their lack of regard to such a serious allergy.More"}
{"review":"We had an excellent pizza with mushrooms, fontina cheese, carmelized onions and arugula, with a crust that was deliziouso. Bravo to the pizzaiolo!"}
{"review":"Great location and relaxed vibe. Friendly and fun server. Pizza had delicious crisp crust and thin base, good prawn dish and salad. Drinks expensive, but that\u2019s what you pay for the view. Husband wanted to return 2 days later for another pizza!"}
{"review":"What a great find. By the sea, great vibe, lovely food, NOT super expensive (and a great playlist going too)\n\nBetween 5 of us we had pizza, chicken bolognaise, meatballs, spicy prawns, salad, roasted vegetables and more and it all disappeared - could have had...more (not a criticism of portion sizes more a testament to the quality of food!)\n\nWe had cycled over from San Fran on a beautiful day and Bar Bocce was a highlight.More"}
{"review":"We decided to wait to order at the bar while waiting to be seated. While waiting in line for the bar a staff member cursed at us for waiting near the door, which is how you get the the bar. It was incredibly uncalled for...and the way we had been instructed to order by several other staff members. We left- I won\u2019t be cussed out by a waiter and I can\u2019t imagine working with this man.More"}
{"review":"Well orchestrated team delivered an enjoyable experience and satisfying meal. We arrived after making the ride from SF, and chose the restaurant based on TripAdvisor ratings and Bar Bocce did not disappoint. Warm and professional greeting, smooth escort to high-top tables inside (it was full...outside by 1230 on a Sunday), drinks in hand watching NCAA in short order. The pizza crust was sublimely light, highly recommended. The Caesar and Kale salads were both good. The chicken Bolognese was the least memorable. Highly recommended for your Sausalito bike trip!More"}
{"review":"We went based on the TripAdvisor reviews and were not disappointed. The lasagna and spinach caesar salad were great and the sausage pizza was pretty good.  The view across the bay is spectacular and it is open on one side, so felt very safe in...these covid times.  I had been turned off by the name, and it does have a bar, but the night we went it was very quiet and nice.  And the service was quick.More"}

{"review":"Bar Bocce was such an amazing find! We were headed to a place next door and this place caught our eye. Everything from the service, view, food and drink  were exceptional. The Fig, Arugula, Goat Cheese, Balsamic pizza was to die for. We even ordered...one to go! Must visit!More"}

Tony\u2019s uses the freshest ingredients, proper seasoning and tangy red sauce and serve up delicious, award-winning...pies. The service is friendly and accommodating. We love eating outside either on the sidewalk or covered patio.More"}

It was really good quality...and very tasty so we decided to return the following evening.\nYou cannot book but we arrived and registered for the waiting list. We asked where we could go to get a drink and the welcome staff found us a couple of seats at the bar while we waited. We were later messaged to say our table was ready and we were seated in the window next to the door which was good as it was a hot day! Initially we waited a bit for menus but once our order was taken all from there on in was good. The pizzas were fab! We left full of pizza and beer and very satisfied with our experience. \nA great spot in North Beach!More"}

I loved the ambiance of this place yes it\u2019s busy but you can see staff are working really hard, we were served very quickly had two pizzas and a salad between the 4 of us, (2 adults 2 kids) we all rally enjoyed it, preferred the ham pizza to the margarita as this tasted slightly salty (kids loved it though) where as the one I had was perfect I loved the texture of the dough \/ crust as well.More"}
{"review":"Busy isn\u2019t the word! This place was heaving. We queued to ask for a  table for 2 and got told it\u2019s about an hour\u2019s wait. To give our number and they\u2019d txt us. An hour later with no txt we returned to check and was...told it\u2019s now another 60-90 minutes wait and it\u2019s faster to order online. We order online, pick up 30 mins later and are on our way back to the hotel to eat our dinner. What a lovely lovely way to spend our last  night in San Francisco. You can\u2019t book online here either so good luck visiting. To top it my pizza was average but my partner\u2019s gluten free one was the best she\u2019s ever had.More"}
{"review":"Honestly the food is brilliant but don\u2019t expect anything from the service which really lets the whole experience down. We are from the U.K. and don\u2019t eat as much as Americans so we\u2019re judged by three separate servers for ordering a pizza to share, we...also asked for more pizza sauce which never came but was charged. I asked if the restaurant had wifi and got the most aggressive retort back saying no why would we have this. Such a shame because the food is so good. \n\nI appreciate that it is difficult to be nice to paying customers but please try harder because the food is so good. Fortunately there are lots of fantastic restaurants in SF so you don\u2019t have to visit here.More"}

Menu had a lot of appealing choices and the special of the day made choosing even harder.\n\nServer appeared quickly and filled those super...thick ceramic mugs with piping hot coffee.  Coffee was just OK.\n\nWe ordered the special omelet (house smoked trout with avocado and some other tasty stuff) with cream scone, the banana rum souffle pancake and the Philadelphia breakfast (poached eggs and homemade scrapple).\n\nThe omelet of the day was very good.  The homemade smoked trout was delicious.  Home fries were very tasty.  Chocolate chip cream scone was very good, too.\n\nBanana rum souffle pancake was good and we appreciated that it was served with real maple syrup but this was our least favorite of the 3 items.\n\nI saw Bette's on Diners Drive-Ins and Dives and they showed the scrapple being made and Guy loving it.  Still, I wasn't sure I made the best ordering choice.  Wow -  Bette's scrapple is delicious.  Poached eggs and rye toast were good.  The grilled roma tomatoes were very tasty.\n\nAtmosphere is pretty good.   Service was very good.  Portion size is fine.  Nobody went home hungry.  If you are looking for monster portion size, this isn't the place for you.  Location was good - fun walking around the area afterwards.  Prices were OK - it worked out to $21 per person.  \n\nWe'll be back.More"}

The service used to be so good but now it seems they really don't care....We were seated in an area we really did not want to sit in because they did not want to take up a large table.

{"review":"I was looking for the best spot in town for a local breakfast and I found it! I read lots of reviews before selecting The Buena Vista. I walked for blocks to dine at this gem. The atmosphere has a nostalgic and authentic feel to...it. Of course I had to try the famous Irish coffee and it did not disappoint! I had the crab cake Benedict, when I tell you it was the best I\u2019ve ever had\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffc melted in my mouth. My server suggested a side of sourdough bread, a necessary SF staple. The staff was attentive and friendly. My server made a point to chat and connect with me, she was very kind and positive. Do yourself a favor and treat yourself to The Buena Vista!More"}
{"review":"Crab cakes and crab melt is excellent. Great service and they are famous for their Irish coffee. I highly recommend this place."}

{"review":"Staff very attentive and friendly. The food was good value for money for the area. Relaxed feel. Fun bar! Great Irish coffee but Guinness not so great!"}
{"review":"We walked a few blocks from the Galleria Park hotel into the Financial district to have Sunday dim sum. It was very good quality with happy, efficient service. As we sat down, two trolleys of dim sum arrived at our table so we had a...portion of soup dumplings before we\u2019d even ordered a drink. So, take time to scan the menu and form a plan of what you want otherwise, like us, you\u2019ll have three or four portions of dim sum on your table. Tsing Tao beer was good and some nice sparkling wine and Sauvignon. The outside of the building is slightly stark but it\u2019s nice inside or there\u2019s outside with heaters. Would happily eat here again.More"}

{"review":"We had the most enjoyable time at Yank Sing on Stevenson\u2026 twice! We enjoyed it so much at the beginning of our trip to California that when we returned to San Francisco at the end of our trip, that was the restaurant that we had...to visit again. \nI have several food allergies and it is typically a hassle when we go to restaurants and ask for dishes without my specific allergens.  At Yank Sing, this was not a problem at all. The hostess came to our table and reviewed what we were about to order, checked each item to make sure it did not include anything that could cause me problems, made other suggestions and then periodically came back to make sure I was ok. She did the same on our second visit. Additionally, she was pleasant, helpful and seemingly very happy doing her job. Quite lovely.\nThe dim sum was fabulous and each dish we ordered (and we ordered a lot), we reordered on our second visit. I still crave the food. It was really was beyond delicious! The wait staff was professional and extremely nice to us. \nIf\/when we return to San Francisco, Yank Sing will be at the top of our must do list - twice!More"}
{"review":"Five adults and a 6 month old baby had dim sum this morning. Excellent variety of dishes and lemon tart dessert. Our server, Lina, was very helpful suggesting dishes, taking a particular interest in what food I had an allergy to, checking in with us...during the meal \u2026plus she was enjoyable with a good sense of humor. You won\u2019t be disappointed eating here!\n\nOne suggestion is for management to install a changing table in one of the rest rooms.More"}
{"review":"This place used to be amazing, but it has really fallen off in recent years. We had 6 small dim sum dishes and it came out to $90, and we were still hungry. Service was good, but the menu is much more limited than I...remember, and it was just OK. There are so many better places that are much more reasonable. Not worth it.More"}
{"review":"Flavors were pretty good.  Limited dim sum menu.  A lot of non-Asians dining here, however, my gf and I enjoyed it for what it was. We aren't dim sum snobs for the most part. The basil shrimp dumpling and the scallop shiu mai were our...favorites for sure. We would go back and enjoy those again. The XLB was solid, had better and had worse.  7 small plates and tea...came out to $120 (including tip). Not cheap. Food came out fast. Service was ok for a dim sum restaurant...did not really check on us, but at least they were not rude. Plenty of parking structures around the area.More"}
{"review":"This is a top quality restaurant serving excellent dim sum and providing efficient service.  We were pleased it opened at 11 am and surprised how quickly it filled up, though we soon realised this was because it\u2019s a thoroughly authentic Chinese restaurant in all senses...(no faux dishes designed for westerners) and the tea was fabulous.  It\u2019ll we lived in San Fran we would eat here regularly but alas we are only visiting briefly.More"}
{"review":"The food tastes as good as the other location. Menu was limited however. Everything is touchless with ordering. You order and pay on your phone. No rolling carts like pre pandemic. Food came out quickly. Restaurant felt cold though."}
{"review":"We have been coming to Yank Sing since the 1970's.  The dim sum quality remains high.  They take covid seriously, with ordering now from a smartphone or tablet -- gone are the carts and staff yelling out the item's name.  There is a nice patio...for distanced outdoor dining.More"}
{"review":"I enjoyed the food at this restaurant. We were placed at a table where we used a QR code to purchase our meal and then it\u2019s brought to our table. Food came out quickly, and tasted great. The only reason for a 3 star is...that there is not much communication with a waiter so you\u2019re on your own.  Seem more like I was making an online order for pickup than eating at a restaurant.More"}
{"review":"I am writing a bad review because the restaurant has not got a good job on its website or on the web indicating that it is not open for indoor seating. Quite the contrary. I called on the phone to see if it would let...me know, when I looked them up at the web indoor dining was checked, and when you went on the website it did not say to go only. We were very disappointing when we got there and the atmosphere was bleak at Rincon center, there wasn\u2019t any seating and it was only to go. I feel deliberately misled by them to not being open about\ufffc the restaurant still being closed. We left without getting food because it was not anywhere we want to sit and eat. As we were leaving another family walked up and was equally disappointed because they thought it was open as well.\ufffcMore"}
{"review":"Outstanding dim sum experience during COVID-19 pandemic. The staff were o-so careful and courteous, never a hint of unawareness of optimal behavior in these unusual times. Menu and service revised to reflect highest standards of public health awareness. And, of course, the food was wonderful...and the service exceptional. While the menu has been pared down, it still is a wonderful experience and you can\u2019t find better dim sum anywhere in the Bay Area.More"}

{"review":"Yank Sing is an excellent restaurant except they can be quite expensive at least on the sit down side.  They also have a take-out place off to the side of the main dining area where they have a walk-up counter.  You can get different combinations...of their food to go.  I usually opt for the Chinese chicken salad which comes with their house (honey mustard) dressing and 2 pot stickers and an egg roll.  It is quite tasty and for under $9 it\u2019s a pretty fair value for lunch in the financial district.  They have other options as well depending on your taste and are all very affordable.More"}

At least Dana made...surw to tell us we will be charged for it.  Seriously?!?! Did they expect me to push it back and say no thanks while everyone was singing happy birthday?!? Couldn\u2019t they have put the little candle on the granita yoghurt dessert my husband ordered?!?\n\nThat was a totally CHEAP move. The bill was $800+; couldn\u2019t they just have shown some gratitude and class?!?  Whoever had that idea, their parents didn\u2019t teach them what\u2019s not cool.More"}
{"review":"This shabby chic restaurant has a great staff, only wish the food was equal to their enthusiasm.  Most of the food is a riff on down to earth dishes, but \"elevated\" to gourmet status with unusual ingredients.  Except for the \"donuts\" and the \"liver pate\"...it felt like a place millennials with lots of money go.  $165 including SF taxes and tips is not worth it. The shrimp taco  and beef lumpia are very ordinary).  The sea urchin  and the lunette pastas were too much of a strong taste for one person and should be shared.  Desserts were uninteresting except for the gratis birthday \"cake\" which was delicious.  The fried sardine was dreadful.More"}

My hubby and my bff shared all the dishes and at first,...I didn\u2019t think there was enough food but there was definitely plenty (see my photos for specifics).  Everything we ordered is a must!  Didn\u2019t get a photo of the bread but you have to order that too.  I mean, it\u2019s just bread, but it\u2019s good bread with GOOD butter.  \n\nOur server went above and beyond.  Forgot her name but I think it\u2019s Evelyn?  She was soooo detailed and was very attentive.  We never had an empty glass of wine\/champagne and food delivery was timed perfectly.  \n\nNotes: Parking was easy, and corkage was $30 I think.  At the time of our visit (mid-November) a vax card was necessary to dine inside. \n\nWould definitely come back again!More"}
{"review":"The service was excellent. Our server, Stephen, discussed menu options and wine pairings. The restaurant accommodated food allergies.

Great food. Great Service.More"}

There was no need for a menu...with her knowledge of the restaurant's food.   She asked about  food allergies  and dietary restrictions and vividly described each item we asked about.  Vegan items are available on request.  Cocktails are crafted for the establishment and are worth the price.\n\n\"Special\" is a word that aptly describes our meal at Rich Table.

What a wonderful surprise. Two of the meals...we've had in SF this past year were disappointing, especially considering the reputations of the restaurants. Our food was very interesting and tasty. Our servers were warm and friendly, as if we lived in the neighborhood. As we left dinner, we both asked ourselves how soon we could get back to Rich Table.More"}

The outside sitting area is one of the nicest of all the covid era outside dining areas....Tables are comfortable, at a distance from each other, there are lovely plantings and a nice barrier. Another A+. The food was a disappointment however: among the four of us only one had a truly exceptional dish - the radiatori -pork ragu. The quail and sea bream were fine but didn't live up to our expectations, nor did the spaghetti. Apple tart with gelato was delicious. A word of caution: the inside space was full and very very loud! If you're looking for a quiet evening sit outside. So, a mixed bag.More"}

If possible plan ahead.More"}

It was great experience to have lunch here for our 8 yr anniversaryMore"}
{"review":"It was good but not five star. I didn\u2019t like the fact that our wine was kept away from table and were reliant on someone bringing the bottle to table. I also thought it was overpriced for what is essentially pasta dishes (more than twice...what you\u2019d pay in Italy). Food pretty tasty though and the restaurant ambience was excellent. Would I go back - at a push. I think other options for an Italian would have to be explored first.More"}

I had admitted to unfortunately booking a reservation in February instead of March as an error and I had reached out to management regarding this explaining my situation with the...intention of still going in March and they still charged me the US$100.00 with no alternative to utilizing the credit for future visit. Management was rigid, unaccommodating and inflexible. For a restaurant that prides themselves with \u201cexcellent service\u201d this was not the case.More"}

{"review":"I read good things about Cotogna while travel planning for SF so I booked a lunch reservation for my family.\n\nAfter visiting Chinatown that morning we walked to Cotogna to make our reservation.  We were seated immediately and found the space very warm and friendly....We ordered the following: \n- Halibut Crudo - Excellent.  A very well thought and perfectly executed dish that delicately balanced all the individual ingredients.  Great way to start the meal.\n- Soppressata Pizza - Very good.  Well made pizza.  Dough was light and not too chewy.  My kids enjoyed it.\n- Penne with pork sausage sugo alla 'Nonna Spencer' & ricotta fresca - Excellent.  A rustic dish that was full of flavour.  I wanted more.\n- Agnolotti del plin \"2003\" con sugo di arrosto - Very good.  Very simple looking but really highlights the quality.  Felt it could add a little cheese for umami, but still a great dish.\n\nService was good.  Took the time to describe the dish when served, which is always nice.  No timing issues at all.  \n\nOverall, a very good start to our trip to SF.  I would definitely consider coming back.  4.5 out of 5.More"}

The yellow beet salad was terrific. Do not order the 1\/2 loaf of focaccia bread- it\u2019s...large but not enough. Might be the best bread I can remember having. Tuscan fried chicken was great. Cacio de Pepe was very good but the portion was extremely small. C\u2019mon- pasta cheese and pepper are cheap- give people a larger bowl.\n\nGelato was terrific- some of the best I\u2019ve had.

Because of covid I was pick a corner private table down stairs in the basement. The setting was very romantic. During our dinner a couple was seated at the bar and asked if they could sit at the table next to us and the hostess said no! I loved this. They made sure each table was spread out. We did the \u201ctrust the chef\u201d option with the wine pairing and it was amazing. The cost is high but worth it to try. Each course is different food with different wine.

{"review":"We booked here for our last night in San Fran after looking at the trip advisor reviews...  It looked nice, was close by and we like Japanese food.  We had the Omakase menu which is essentially a number of courses, each devised by the chef...so you don't know what you are getting.  Food was generally ok but not outstanding and there was plenty of it as is par for the course in the US.  High points were the Wagyu beef which was lovely and the dessert course which comprised fresh fruit as well as another four different desserts.  Low points -  the sashimi was sliced over 1cm thick which is too big and also had the skin left on.  The fish course was lobster which was basically inedible as it was so tough and we sent it back.  To be fair, they did then send out the black miso cod.  With two teeny glasses of white wine the bill was $400.More"}
{"review":"We arrived to fine one guy on reception talking on the phone and completely ignoring us. Not even a quiet word apologizing for the wait. We stood there for more than 5 minutes before he finished his call and acknowledged our presence. After we sat...down the manager came round asking if we were enjoying our evening and I politely suggested that there should always be two people on the front desk. He told me that there should be, apologized profusely, and ordered two glasses of wine for us on the house, which was a really nice touch. He immediately went to investigate and came back to explain what had happened and apologized again. \n\nWe didnt less this ruin our evening. The food was excellent, and the service was very good, although I would agree with other reviewers that there might actually be too many wait staff there and it isnt clear what everyone's job is and who is doing what. It got a little confusing! But that doesnt take away from the fact that the sushi was excellent, as were the other dishes that we tried, and we absolutely would go back there again if we were in town.More"}

{"review":"Was taken here for dinner by a close friend and the first question was is it related to Roka in London?  couldn't get a clear answer. There were many and I mean too many wait staff.  so many in fact it became confusing who to...turn to with requests.  Then there seemed to be an 'overeager' effort to please. So much so that it bordered on patronizing.  Staff were helpful and polite but just seemed not very aware and as if they were running of a script, not natural.  The food was good and the sushi was super fresh which was delightful.  All in all i think it definitely worth a visit. But keep expectations reasonable.More"}
{"review":"Greens is always a treat whether you are a vegetarian or not. Non vegetarians often don\u2019t notice. The view and dining room with its high ceilings , good acoustics, warm woods and nicely spaced tables is welcoming. We were there fo Brunch which had a...decidedly Mexican touch as compared to previous visits. Everything was good but coffee was weak. We go to Greens for the location - the food can be 4\/5 but the room, easy to park or walk location and the view make it a favorite.More"}
{"review":"Have been coming here almost since it\u2019s opening. While the view and the interior have stayed the same, the food has evolved. I loved it then and still love it. Had breakfast with a very Mexican influence. It\u2019s nice to see a restaurant change but...maintain its quality. Only shortcoming was the coffee was a little anemic.More"}
{"review":"Most likely I've overlooked this restaurant because it's vegetarian. On a friends suggestion, we met here and I really enjoyed my dinner. Our table, though miniscule, was at the window overlooking the water. We shared a handful of starters with the gluten free accommodations they...offer up on the menu. My favorite was the Muhammara. The Broccolini and Johnny Cakes were also delicious. I would eat here again.More"}
{"review":"Their website says that the opening of Greens in 1979, has forever changed the image and appreciation of vegetarian food in America. Recommended highly by the cognoscenti, Greens quite lives up to its reputation.\n\nThe location brings it great value. Nestled in Fort Mason which...is replete with history, with views of the Bay and the Golden Gate Bridge, tastefully done muted interiors and the neatly laid out tables outdoor with space heaters that blunt the sharp winds blowing off the Bay, it\u2019s a big thumbs up for the ambience.\nFor the entrees we ordered a Small Plate of Grilled peaches with goat cheese, watercress salad, honey and hazelnuts. The peaches were grilled just enough, without taking away the softness and aroma of the fruit. The goat\u2019s cheese took a little getting used to but the watercress salad, honey and roasted hazelnut brought it all together to a nicety. The soup of the day, chickpea in tomatoes was pure comfort food - nothing new nothing distinctive.\n The Roasted Heirloom Tomato Pizza  with farm herbs and mozzarella was very good. The crust and cheese done to perfection and the herbs and tomatoes both subtle yet rich with authenticity.\n Chipotle Barbecued Eggplant with summer beans, corn, tomatoes, roasted poblanos and jalapeno cornbread was a bit underwhelming. The eggplant was a tad too dominant, jalape\u00f1o cornbread did not really fit in and the roasted poblanos could have had a stronger presence. Yet there was not a single jarring element. \nThe portions are deceptive and we had no space left for dessert. This was a happy thing because we were already looking forward to coming back.\nWith such a formidable reputation, a premium location and an uncommon cuisine, Greens could have been much heavier on the purse. \nIf at all one has to pick a bone it would be that there could have been more on the menu. Exclusively vegetarian restaurants are hard to come by and a few more options would have been welcome.More"}
{"review":"One of the best (possibly THE best) meals we had in California.  My non-vegetarian husband was skeptical, but the spring rolls, potato stacks, and wild mushroom Shepherd's Pie were outstanding.  The Pinot Grape soda was so refreshing we never got around to ordering wine!  Our...server was delightful and gave us good recommendations for touring the botanical garden, and the view can't be beat.  11\/10!More"}

{"review":"My husband and I went to Greens following recommendations from two people. Both the food and the view were great.We enjoy vegan and vegetarian food and there was plenty to choose from. We shared a salad to start. It was fresh and the dressing was...delicious. We then had a tofu korma and a wild mushrooms dish. Both were super tasty and well presented. Dessert was a chocolate dish with pieces of fresh orange on the side. It was dark and rich and plenty for 2. Even the coffee we finished with was above average. Would highly recommend.More"}
{"review":"This is an old school vegetarian restaurant. A Mom-and-Pop for sure! Also the waiter said \"good choice this has been on the menu for 30 years\" when I ordered the Corn\/sweet potato cakes with over easy eggs. Very well balanced dish with the rather dry...cakes that got that creaminess from the runny eggs and the avocado and some crunch from the cabbage.. Yummy. The lentil soup was delish too. A little pricey but the location is also amazing with the view over the bay and the Golden Gate Bridge. \nBonus points for VERY eclectic wooden furniture too! :DMore"}

{"review":"I\u2019ve loved this place for years, having enjoyed many good meals there, but no more.  There are still a few dishes that shine like the fried tofu (ordered from the staff rather than a cart), but all the steamed dishes there now, save a few...exceptions, taste more or less the same.   The dumplings which used to burst with flavor are now more gummy than tasty.  The wait staff also seem less professional as does the service overall which was hit or miss, something that I have never experiences there before.  There is also very little that is innovative or creative about the food which again was not the case.   I think it is possible to have a decent meal there, but with so many other great dim sum restaurants in the bay area it visit, I can\u2019t see any reason to go back.   And it\u2019s not exactly inexpensive!    A sad day here!More"}
{"review":"This was one of many return visits to Yank Sing over the past 30+ years.  YS has never disappointed in terms of food. Each dish that I have craved has always lived up to expectation, especially the Shangai (soup) dumplings and each shrimp-dominated item.  YS...remains the best in terms of dim sum quality and variety.\n\nWhat to complain about: you do have to wait for the carts to come by and that cart may not contain what you're looking for.  OTOH, the cart pushers\/waiters are all wired and they will summon another cart with the item you want.\n\nYank Sing is expensive and will run about $30\/person, or higher.  Is it worth it?  You bet.  Will I return?  Can't wait.More"}

The food was good but not as good as it used to be! Many dishes were overcooked,...not as refined and delicate as dim sum should be! The only dish worth a special mention was the Peking duck on a bun ( to be ordered). Desserts and especially the sesame balls saved it! \nOn our. Ext trip we\u2019ll be looking for over dim sum places! Yank Sing has been surviving on its past reputation and should really improve the quality.More"}

They were spot on. \n\nDeserving of their Michelin Star, this is the perfect choice for a great Dim Sum dining experience. \n\nThe restaurant is located inside a beautiful office building. Its...clean and bright but not much ambience. No music was playing while we were there. \n\nFrom THE SECOND you sit down, you are approached with servers rolling carts offering dishes. They were a tad overwhelming at first as we had barely sat and they were asking what we wanted.\n\nI suggest you first take time to review the menu, order a drink and then start your selections. Every one we tried was outstanding. You will fill quickly. \n\nTip: try the stuffed Lotus Leaf and eggplant! Yummy!More"}

{"review":"I was at this Yank Sing a few months ago and again yesterday. The reservation system is good and both times we were seated promptly. During the earlier visit, a waiter came over promptly and took our order for tea. (There are several kinds available.)...This time we were only served water (without asking - I thought that wasn't allowed). I finally flagged down a waiter only to be told that the tea had to be ordered using my phone! The process was easy after scanning the QR code on the small menu laying on the table, but really? I was shocked by this. Considering the price for tea - which I don't begrudge them - it should be available by request. We chose the rest of our food from the circulating carts. We were quite happy with the food. Other than the tea incident, everything went smoothly. I'm only afraid that the next time I go, we will forced to be order food, and it will be delivered using robotic carts traveling to and from the kitchen.More"}
{"review":"Terrible takeout experience from here. Dropped my order off at the desk of my hotel with no contact. Finally discovered it 30 minutes later once food was cold. To make it worse: no sauce of any kind for our dumplings and no utensils or napkins...either. For almost 200$ worth of dumplings, having them cold and sauce-less was so disappointing. Don\u2019t waste your money on takeout from here. I\u2019m sure the food is good in person, but takeout should be up to par too.More"}

{"review":"We had a family friend visiting from Argentina and thought this would be a nice place to bring her.  The location is amazing, especially if it is a clear day, as it sits right on the bay.  We did not have reservations (we were 3...people), but we were seated fairly quickly for lunch.  The table was not ideal at all and although we asked for a different table, we were told that nothing else was available.  The table seemed to be right in the path of the servers trying to navigate through the restaurant, and sure enough, through the entire lunch, one of us was constantly getting pushed by wait staff or customers as they squeezed by (super irritating) to get where they were going.\n\nThe food was okay.  Nothing spectacular.  We ordered the beet salad, a fish sandwich and mushroom ravioli, as well as regular fries and sweet potato fries (only drinks were water).  And, it was all fine.  No complaints, but that was about $90, and portions were not large.  It was also pretty noisy, so conversation was hard.  I would recommend trying to get a table next to the window or a booth.  Our table was just smack dab in the middle of the dining room.\n\nThe one thing that seemed pretty nervy was that when the check came, and it was already not a cheap meal, they include \"suggested tip amounts\" that start at 20% and go up.  I know tipping has gotten out of hand, but starting tipping at 20%?  It used to be 20% was considered a very good tip.  Now, it's at the bottom!More"}

{"review":"Excellent food and great service in a decidedly upscale and intimate environment. But the upsetting and cross selling of menu items is a turn off. It's almost like buying an already expensive car and then the dealer pushing an array of options that you already...thought were included in the priceMore"}
{"review":"The food and ambiance were very good. The kitchen staff know how to prepare the dishes well. However, the menu is structured in such a way that the wait staff try to upsell the customer on so many different components. It's not just about paying...extra for caviar service, which is to be expected, but multiple components of a regular prix fix meal are add-ons (i.e. standard scallop appetizer comes with 3 scallops but it's $12 extra - and not clearly communicated; if you want a better cut of meat for your steak it's $XX; if you want a cheese course instead of dessert it's $15; etc.). Not talking about one or two add ons - there are multiple. So many in fact that it's hard to keep track of. Even the waitress who was serving us admitted it was too many and admitted that the restaurant is trying to change. For the customer, it's not a great experience.More"}
{"review":"So excited to go to Spruce for the first time with friends - we are all in the food\/wine industry, so admittedly expectations were high. Service was sub-par but not for lack of effort--our server was spread way too thin and had too many tables....We waited a long, long  time to order our first bottle of champagne--then the first course didn't arrive till it was almost gone. Second bottle of wine did not get served at the time we requested, and so pairing with our food was off...Then our dessert wines had the same problem (ordered but not delivered for a long time). The som recognized this and comp'd them. Food was good, but wow-factor was missing. Highlights were lobster, scallops, parker rolls, and rhubarb choux. I would skip the rib-eye. Hope management finds a way to improve wine service in this very busy restaurant to avoid customer disappointment and live up to its Michelin rating. There are LOTS of staff, but they should be better managed.More"}
{"review":"Late service, bread sliced early so it was almost dry on both sides, butter tasteless, white asparagus and sauce good, escalopes tasteless, rib eye anything but, cheese cake not to my taste as texture. I would not dine again at Spruce."}
{"review":"We had the baby beet salad and the scallops as the first courses. They were excellent.: the melted leeks were smooth and superb, and the scallops were seared to perfection. My wife liked the cauliflower, but I was not impressed with the rib-eye; the Bordelaise...sauce was watery and insipid. The cheese plate was an inspired selection of delicious French cow milk. Unfortunately, the creme anglaise for the beignets was runny and mediocre. It was a bit disappointing that the cooking staff could not produce decent basic sauces, but I recommend the restaurant overall.More"}
{"review":"I dined here on my own last time in September 22 visiting from outside the US and have just booked a table to return on my next visit with in February. Why? I know SF has so many great restaurants but I enjoyed everything about...dining here so much that when returning to the city now with my wife I am not even contemplating dining elsewhere. The food and wine is outstanding but everything about it is unpretentious and relaxing. Having dined at many 1,2 and 3 star restaurants over the years it is the simple combination of the above that I look for these days.More"}
{"review":"We really enjoyed this price fixe 3-course experience last night. First, our waiter Ryan was exceptional - so knowledgeable and personable with a fantastic Sancerre wine recommendation to go with the delicately prepared and flavored tuna; my wife\u2019s lobster was excellent; the scallops and the...fagottini appetizers were creative and delicately executed.  The atmosphere is elegant and comfortable with some cool music playing in the background.  Overall, just a fun and delightful time in Pacific Heights.More"}
{"review":"This is an outstanding restaurant! The food was delicious, with good variety and excellent presentation. Service is attentive but not hovering. Beautiful bar, inventive cocktails.

{"review":"A bit of a treat to come here!\nIt was fantastic, fine dining at its finest!\n\nThank you to Mr Elliott who showed us to our table. Our waitress was great and the sommelier helped us chose a fantastic wine. Their wine list is out...of this world! It\u2019s like a book.\n\nWe couldn\u2019t decide what we wanted for dessert so the lovely waitress just ordered them all for us!\n\nThe food was beautiful. Really lovely flavours and quality.\n\nWe left feeling very full and satisfied!More"}
{"review":"The food here was amazing but the service was awful. Our server paid almost no attention to our table and there were periods of time where our drinks sat empty for almost 20 minutes which was completely unacceptable. It\u2019s too bad because the food was...great but the lack of service ruined the experience for us. They add an automatic 20% gratuity fee to the bill so I\u2019m not sure if that played a part in it that they were already getting a good tip no matter what the service level they provided?More"}
{"review":"Loved the atmosphere and decorations! We ended staying at the bar for drinks and dinner and couldn't have enjoyed more. Gabriel was great explaining the menu and cocktails!"}
{"review":"After being nearly stranded on the wrong side of the bridge after a long walk, they accommodated our late arrival and presented a delicious menu and bested me multiple times on what were perfect wine pairings for the food. Food and wine this good can...often feel stuffy, and we just felt welcomed after our very long walk through San Francisco. I had last visited to snag a few delicious wines from their wine cellar sale during the pandemic, and I was so happy to finally experience such good food.More"}
{"review":"This spot was great for a business event in San Francisco.  The food and drinks were good and the staff friendly.  Highly Recommended!"}
{"review":"Myself and a colleague ate at Lolinda. My Bife de Chorizo steak was exceptionally good. Yuca fries were also very good. Extensive wine list"}
{"review":"Wonderful food and wine! Sweet and attentive service! We brought 3 kids although there were no kids menu, they could easily eat from the main menu!"}
{"review":"We were finally able to try Lolinda.  It was not really worth the wait.\n\nNot Spanish, Lolinda bills itself as able to transport a patron \"from the streets of the Mission to a one-of-a-kind Argentinian experience.\"  It is here where, according to its website, that...Lolinda's chef strives to \"create a curated menu that combines Latin American flavors with California sensibilities.\"\n\nThe dark place is not intimate.  It is crowded, with small tables pushed close together.  Conversation with the person across from me was difficult at best.  A loud, see-and-be-seen place that seems all too typical in San Francisco now, this is what unwashed diners in the City want.  I guess.\n\nFood was good, if a bit over-priced given the size of the portions.  Wines were decent pours by the glass, and at reasonable prices.  Suggest trying the sparkling Malbec ros\u00e9; dry, hint of the grape skins, nice finish.\n\nIn trying to find a real Argentine style empanada, gonna have to keep looking.  While the mostly vegetarian filling in the Hongo was excellent, the pastry dough was almost too sweet and buttery - like an apple or cherry turnover.  Sweet or savory?  Here, you can have both, at once, in every bite.  Passssssss.\n\nYou know I love octopus, and so we ordered the pulpo.  Small dish, some pieces too salty and overcooked, while others were almost raw.  The broccolini was cooked perfectly, still dark green and firm.  The champinones (mushrooms) were one of the highlights served in the style of many Buenos Aires eateries, with the hot mushrooms on the bottom and a cold bed of arugula on top.\n\nWith the seco de carne (beef short ribs) was a polenta I wish I could make.  This was probably the highlight.  Creamy, but not too creamy, with garlic and a wine reduction drizzle.\n\nService was awful.  Our waiter initially talked up the Argentina angle, but then pushed Peruvian ceviche on us (we passed).  Yeah, it's a Latin (or South) American dish one can also find in places that feature cuisine from Ecuador, Chile, Colombia, and even Mexico, but it ain't typically Argentine.\n\nThe staff was in a hurry as it was getting close to closing time, but our guy tried to leave without taking our order.  When he did deign to take our order, we waited interminably and then things were just dumped on the table.  And as soon as a dish appeared done, \"zip, zip, zip,\" the plate was magically gone from our table.  We must have had six or seven staff at our table, but we had to cancel one item that never arrived.  Delay, delay, delay, and then pow-pow-pow-pop.\n\nNot worth the wait, the cost, or the trouble parking in the Mission at night.  I can think of better places to take my hunger and chubby face.  However, if you only come alive when dining with 60-70 of your new best friends talking app-shop, glued to phones, with sketchy service, and eating about half of every portion brought to their tables, then this is your spot.\n\nMakes one wonder, though.  It's the old chicken versus egg debate.  Do places like Lolinda morph into eateries where patrons still stinking of sweat and gym-drizzle feel literally at home in their funk and on their phones, or did Lolinda and its ilk engender the 21st Century Diner sans souci?  The world may never know.\n\n- workingman's gourmandMore"}

{"review":"I had two really different experiences here, both during Covid. As an initial matter, I'll say the food is good, it's fine--steakhouse fare, nothing spectacular but done well. My first visit was my sister's 50th birthday (during COVID0 and we were about a dozen people,...and the staff was fabulous. The second visit (also during COVID), was really different. We were a table of six, and from the get-go, we felt very rushed. They did not take into account their own delay in serving our table (or taking or orders) and at the end, they told  us we just had to leave because we'd stayed outside the COVID window. I won't be coming back.More"}

{"review":"Great Argentinean steakhouse in the Mission district. Much more casual and lively than other steak options in SF. I had the ribeye which was really good, far better than the steaks I usually get in the UK. Service was very friendly too and afterwards, I...went to the rooftop bar next door, which as good too.More"}
{"review":"Not that expensive, they have 4 or 5 different steaks of around 200gms, a dinner for two will be in the $150 USD one drink each"}
{"review":"This is a lively Argentine steakhouse in the Mission- gorgeous interiors, great service and lots of interesting plates to share. The servers are particularly helpful in guiding you through the menu options and portions. The skirt steak is a personal favorite. Be warned, it is...on the loud side.More"}
{"review":"Argentine is not what we were thinking. The food was good and service attentive enough. The idea is to order a couple of different meals that are served to share at the table. As just two of us one entree and side was really enough....Very happening place. Loud but nice atmosphere.More"}
{"review":"We had a delightful family dinner at Lolinda on our final night in San Francisco. Four of us had complete steak dinners and a couple of drinks - total including tip was $300. But we felt worth it! Nice setting. Good service."}

{"review":"My husband I LOVE Burma Super Star but sadly have to say their tea salad has gone downhill. Today and on our previous last visit, the salad was bland, way too oily (almost watery), lacking in ingredients and nothing special. We would look so forward...to eating it that we\u2019d make a special trip to do so.  I had the tea leaf salad\/samosa soup lunch special today and was glad to have the soup to balance out my meal. Soup was flavorful and good on a cool day.More"}
{"review":"Food was horrible, but the guy answering the phone was so nice. . . .  Sucked.\n\nOrdered garlic noodles, light on the oil (some places make them so greasy that  you need a shower afterward).  Greased to the max, dude.  And no friggin' garlic.  Greasy,...clumped, flavorless noodles.\n\nTea leaf salad was okay.  But, I've had better.  Good-sized portion.\n\nSamusa soup is a vegetarian dish.  Instead, we had a bowl of meat.  Bizarre.  Is this Opposite Day?  Someone is messing with me.\n\nTake-out.  One and done, again.\n\nI am sick of this crap.  Covid and the horrors of the restaurant business and lousy tippers and red-state morons -- these excuses only go so far.  Every order is messed up.  A bowl of meat -- literally -- and not the vegetarian dish?    Greasy, clumped noodles in a dish that was to be light -- \"less oily\" -- ???!!!\n\nNever again.  Crappy food is, well, crappy food.\n\n-- Workingman's gourmand.More"}
{"review":"Food is amazing. Service is fantastic. And covid19 safety is top-notch. \n\nIf you haven't had their tea leaf salad, you missed an important part of life. It's impossible to explain the tea leaf salad experience, so I won't try, except to say it's an out-of-this...world combination of flavors and textures. If you're allergic to nuts, don't touch it. Otherwise, OMG. \n\nThere's a noodle dish that's served cold. Can't remember what it's called, but it's, well, amazing. Imagine fresh, white cold noodles with chunks of perfectly al dente potato. There's a mix of slightly spicy and slightly sweet. There's carrot shavings, onions, and, perhaps garlic. The tofu pieces are firm and infused with flavor. \n\nThe mango chicken and mango shrimp are also to die for (sorry, I hate that phrase, but it fits). \n\nCome here early because there's often a LONG wait. Tonight I was dining alone, so I somehow managed to walk right in and get seated. They've also got a nice outdoor dining area.More"}
{"review":"Burma Superstar still has delicious food but the prices are now out in the stratosphere. It is just not a good value anymore. Not only has the owner raised prices on every menu item AGAIN, he has also added a COVID fee. The bill for...two people was over $82 and we did not have any cocktails! This was before tip. A cup of tea was $5. I asked the waitress if I could have the carafe of tea, as they used to serve it.

I will not be returning.More"}
{"review":"We ordered quite a few dishes so we could sample. All of the food was great! We weren\u2019t stoked on the samosas but otherwise very happy with our food. COVID take out was a breeze from the restaurant. \nWe ordered: the coconut rice (amazing), the...mango shrimp \ud83d\ude0d, samosas, platha which comes with a type of chicken curry to dip (one of my favorites!), garlic noodles, spicy green beans (great side dish) and the spicy chicken balls (not the best but still good).\nI highly recommend trying a variety of things! Great to split with friends and family. \nThe platha was definitely one of my favorites, but who doesn\u2019t like any type of butter flat bread. \nEnjoy! Easy to order online.More"}
{"review":"We've eaten here many times in the past and always enjoyed it but not anymore.  Today we took out dinner for the first time and it couldn't have been worse. What a huge disappointment!  The Curry Shrimp had no curry taste whatsoever. The sauce was...red, super oily with no taste of curry, just oil.\nThe Rainbow salad was so so but again a super oily dressing with an horrible taste, killed the salad flavors.\nThe 2 stars are for the coconut rice that still tastes as used to.  There goes $60... what a waste.\nI'm shocked that this restaurant is still holding #2 on TA.  I won't go back!More"}

We had the tea-leaf salad (\"it's like a party in your mouth!\") which was a delicious and complex combination of flavors and textures--fresh, lime-y, bitter, crunchy--so good! We also enjoyed the platha--a griddle-fried bread...a bit like a thick crepe--with chicken curry dip, and the mango chicken with noodles. Everything was served fresh and hot and was super tasty! We also got prosecco mimosas, and the bill was very reasonable. Highly recommend!More"}

Until last night....don't get me wrong, I am not bashing the restaurant, but I want to add balance to the reviews.  i don't know if it was an off night for...the chef, but here are my small criticisms.\n\nThe sesame chicken had an aftertaste of smoke\/oil....like it was fried in burnt oil.\n\nMany of the garlic broccoli pieces were too large to eat in one bite. (or even two!) I feel like the prep cook got lazy.\n\nSomething was not quite right with the tea leaf salad dressing.  I couldn't put my finger on it, but something needed to be added or decreased.  It was definitely not the same as in previous visits.\n\nWith that said, the service was EXCELLENT, and the food was definitely good enough to eat....I am just worried that the quality may be slipping.  \n\nIf you have never eaten here, please try it.  If you have eaten here before, I am wondering if anyone else feels the same.\n\nWill update after next visit.More"}

The menu is QR code for smart phone use, but we saw a table receive actual menus. \n     The food was decent. It was hot when served. Prices were more expensive than we were used to, but we were in San Francisco.

Its too much of a security risk to add it manually on a piece of paper after the card payment has been processed and approved without me adding my pin into a machine, hopefully they will update this way of working soon to help provide more tips for the staff.\nThey had already added the sales tax and an employee mandated 5% on to the bill.More"}

{"review":"Pizzas are good. The Pattie\u2019s are of good quality using proper flour and enough raising time.\n\nAntipasto of vegetable are good.\n\nOtherwise:\n* Fried Calamaries  : these are supposed to be their specialities but the frying oil need a change from time to time\n2\/10...from an Italian food afficinado\n\n* spaghetti with meat sauce : a tryout of spaghetti Raghu alla bolognese. \nA shame. Slurpy pasta ( pre cooked probably) \nThe sauce does not stick to pasta.\n1\/10 \n\n* tagliatelle with clamps: a shameful version of spaghetti alle vongole.\nIt soaks is oil, garlic and frozen parsley\nThey at not fresh at all, over cooked and dry \n0\/10\n\nIt seems they live on their historical fame.\nOwners are not the originals ones. It seems to be taken over by a native Italian, cooking a food far way from what you could get in Italy.\nThat restaurant would go bankrupt overnight in Italy.\n\nGood pop for a pizza, better than most what you could get in USA but for the rest forget about it. \n\nNo return to this place possible \n\nThey boast themselves about some stars having come the place \n\nA tourist trap.\n\nThey had 2 stars because of their pizza, otherwise, it would have been only one \n\nMaybe Americans love it, in such case, I have nothing else to say. The restaurant adapts itself to local taste but they can\u2019t call themselves Italian food.More"}
{"review":"We split a Caesar Salad, it was large and excellent. We were glad we split it because it was so big. We ate the baked eggplant parmigiana, it came out piping hot and it was very tasty. Restaurant is off Columbus but worth the walk!...Highly recommend going for good Italian food.More"}
{"review":"Short wait and challenging parking however, some of the best Italian food we've eaten.  While they are known for their pizza, the lasagna is amazing.  Skip the chicken Parmesan, and dessert."}

{"review":"A local bar recommend here as family owned and food. My husband liked the lasagna. We got the beef carpaccio together and it was just okay -we\u2019ve had some really good ones before but this was not delicate melt in your mouth and there was...too much onion.  I had the seafood pasta and picked the seafood out but the rest was just not that flavorful. It did get busy with a lot of pizza headed out so maybe best to try the pizza as clearly there are great recommendations hereMore"}
{"review":"We (couple) were there for Friday night dinner out. There was a queue to be seated, so book in advance is not a bad idea (we booked as we left home to be seated an hour later). The place is small and relative noisy (when...full of people), but it has a nice vibe and nice atmosphere (especially if you seat in a booth style table; still normal chairs and tables but just divided from the rest). The service was fast and nice. We had the salad of the month - a bit dry but nice paired tastes, homemade pasta with meatballs - the tomato sauce is amazing & a pizza with cheese and rucola - amazing bread, amazing flavor. To drink we had wine (by the glass). The total price was logical for the place and quality and quantity of the food (~$100).More"}
{"review":"I was walking around North Beach and discovered this place after 40 years of visiting this particular neighborhood, I teach photography in this location and was thrilled to find this restaurant. I went back when they opened and I'm happy I did as it was...the last day before closing for the Christmas holiday. I had the spaghetti and meatballs and my mother was Sicilian so I rarely find a restaurant that can cook as good as she did. Well I found it! I love the setup of this place - there is a huge common table in the center so as a solo diner I felt at home talking to people who were sitting there waiting to eat after ordering. Made friends, drank great wine, and devoured my meal, I'll definitely go again and you shouldn't miss it!More"}
{"review":"Wonderfull as ever. Had pizza  ,clams, caesar salad, veal picatta, new dessert and glass of Tomaso's red wine."}
{"review":"Fantastic Italian food huge portions had the lasagna and forced myself to eat it all because it was so good."}
{"review":"Decent, mixed, but unimpressive.\n\nHad visiting family, and they chose Tommaso's online.  Mostly because listing\/menu said \"baked clams - a specialty.\"\n\nNice, old-school vibe when you enter.  Very friendly host.  Offered us a glass of wine as we waited.  Made suggestions.  Kept us apprised of...table-status.  \n\nIt's a small, downstairs location... one long communal table down the center surrounded by old-fashioned cubbies - quasi-booths really tables and chairs separated by walls.  Nice, old-times vibe.   Its loud, friendly, lotsa pizza orders. \n\nHostess, bus, waitperson who brought dessert, all very friendly,  smiling.  Our main waitperson appeared to be the only staffer we saw who never smiled.  No suggestions.   No helpful comments.  We'd ask \"is xxxx good?\" She'd say \"yes.\"  I finally asked \"are you going to just say everything's good?\" and got a tight-grin as a response. \n\nChianti recommended by hostess was good.\n\nMenu is very minimal.  Names of dishes, minimal or no description of ingredients or preparation.\n\nThey put some very hot bread on the table... nice that it was very fresh,  but its a mushy-soft tasteless white bread reminiscent of something you can buy frozen at the grocery store and bake yourself.  Had to ask for a refill, and refill came partially warm, partially chilled.  They're definitely baking from pre-made; whether pre-made in-house or purchased - can't tell.\n\nI started with carpaccio.  Generous portion.   But nothing noteworthy.  No offer of bread.  Others ordered baked fresh clams.  No description on menu other than \"a specialty.\"  Traditional Italian baked clams are topped with bread crumbs, herbs, laid out, etc.  This was a bowl of clams in a broth, much more like italian steamed clams.  Tasty broth, but unremarkable.  As the reason for choosing Tommaso's, big disappointment. \n\nI ordered eggplant parmesan - again, no description on menu.  Traditional eggplant parm is sliced eggplant, dipped in egg batter, fried, then laid out in a casserole with sauce and cheese.  This was just sliced eggplant, a relatively tasteless marinara, and cheese. Result: mushy eggplant.   Not bad, but not much better than a frozen entree.  A side of lukewarm penne topped with about 2-3 TB of the same marinara was plopped down beside it - I didn't know it was coming, or might have asked for an option, rather than exact same sauce as eggplant.   Others' pasta sides served at the table had much more sauce, and were hotter as a result.\n\nThe seafood pasta ordered by another was much better.  Two said their Rolletini was good.  But good was the best anyone could say... nothing excellent, no \"wow.\"\n\nOverall, there's a family style vibe, but it borders on conveying that no one cares about presentation - food's just dumped in bowls and pushed out of the kitchen. \n\nTiramisu served in small soup cup was mediocre and lacking in either espresso or liqueur flavor.  I had  cannoli, I asked if fresh-filled, etc.  Friendly support waitress assured me it was... Cannoli was very good.   Cannoli and chianti were only things that weren't disappointments.\n\nFamily visiting from out of town referred to experience as their only \"miss\" or disappointment of their trip to \"foody san francisco.\"\n\nI might go in there to try a pizza... every pizza we saw go by looked excellent.   But I wouldn't go back for entree-dinner.More"}
{"review":"We were seated at a tiny two-top in a small space that held three such tables. Talk about cramped - the oil and vinegar was housed on the wall behind us. Dinner salad was fine, but not outstanding. Sadly, that was the best part of...the meal. Both of our pastas were pretty tasteless. Our waiter seemed uninterested in service. I really couldn\u2019t wait to leave and find cappuccino elsewhere. Arrivederci!More"}
{"review":"Visited Tommaso as part of a culinary tour of the area. Pizza was very good - thin crust (which was great!), tomato sauce and toppings.\nPlace has long history dating back to 1935. If you can get one of the old timers to tell some...of the stories - it would make the experience much more significant.More"}
{"review":"My wife recommended that I try this place. It gets busy fast, so keep that in mind. I ordered the manicotti with meatballs, which was the best I have had. As an Italian that makes my own red sauce, I had yet to find an...equal...until now. Their tiramisu was also the best I had ever had and the server even threw in chocolate salami in appreciation for our compliments. Told my mom about this place, so she went this week while in the city and loved it as well.More"}
{"review":"I used to love this place for their monthly specials when I lived in San Francisco. I got the lasagna today and it was a whole different story . It tasted like anything but lasagna. in particular, it had this wierd super thick layers of...jello like texture with flour and butter flavor. I supposed it was meant to presnt roccota. Service was mediocreMore"}
{"review":"The food tasted good especially the carrot and coriander soup.with granny smith balls! \n\nThe duck was lovely but a small portion \n\nMy only  criticism was the speed with which the meal is served. It\u2019s verging in fast food. The limited menu means all\nmeals are...ready to go. \n\nAs a solo diner you take more notice of the proceedings. They really try to get maximum buck from their tables!More"}
{"review":"We were hiking thru the touristy parts  of Fisherman\u2019s Wharf passing time, taking in the sights and sounds of the city.  And as we headed towards Trestle, the neighborhood turned nicer and quieter.  And in the shadow of the TransAmerica building we found the restaurant...on the corner of Columbus.  Had to wait a bit so as not to take the table by the door in the walkway and the cold. But the wait was worth it.  The interior of the small space is cozy and welcoming.  The restaurant does a modified pre-fixe. One choice for vegetarian\/pescatarian.  And another with some meat.  Pasta dishes can be added for a $12 up charge and are shareable.  Nice wine list.  Definitely r,ember to ask for the grilled bread and whipped butter.  No charge but you have to ask for it.   Food was really good.  Had the corn soup. The basil chicken.  And the deserts were yummy.  All in all a nice time.  Nice wait staff.  And great atmosphere.  Worth it.More"}
{"review":"Food was nothing but amazing! Very tasty and well balanced full of flavor. Went to celebrate my anniversary with my wife and definitely they went to the next level.

Service was excellent, they explain you the menu and how it works if it\u2019s your first time visiting them. It\u2019s great located right in the heart of San Francisco, the spot is nice and has a great atmosphere. Definitely will go back!More"}
{"review":"This was a fix menu\/ the asparagus soup\nWas mediocre. The branzino was burned and half of a regular size and  the desert was again mediocre.I waited 30 hr for the desert. The  waiters are young and overwhelmed. \nA huge disappointment."}
{"review":"Unfortunately a big disappointment. It was noisy, and the service was great but a little too fast (I was aware of this from reading reviews). Food was really disappointing. Only two choices from each course so we tried everything. The cabbage salad was hard to...eat and bland. The chicken main course was dry and not very special. The chocolate dessert was inedible it was so bittersweet. We ate our dinner in less than an hour, an experience not worth the taxi ride. The quantities were small as you would expect from Michelin level dining but the quality wasn't. They are trying to appear Michelin level but aren't meeting the mark by a long shot.More"}
{"review":"It's the best food I have had in a long time. The menu changes weekly, take a peek before you go. Its $42 now. Definitely add the pasta course if hungry.  Presentation and service were friendly and professional.  I loved the flowers, the tableware, the...wine list and the playfulness of the menu.  There were dates, business colleagues and beautiful people on a night out. It's a bit loud. But you'll be so happy you were there.More"}
{"review":"We were a table of five.  Successes were the pumpkin soup, the mushroom risotto and short rib pappardelle.  Also good were the sole and duck.  The orange cornmeal cake was light but average.  Better was the dark chocolate mousse.  Cocktails were good as was the...service which was prompt and efficient.More"}
{"review":"While we were visiting SF we decided to visit Trestle restaurant as it was recommended by envibe app and have no regrets about it \u00a0The food was tasty(Pumpkin\u00a0Bolognese is something should try ), good service, and nice prices as well."}
{"review":"We turned up at 6pm - our allotted time - for a meal with our son, his girlfriend and his girlfriend\u2019s parents who we had only very recently  met. We were seated promptly (thanks) and menus provided (thanks). It\u2019s a $39 fixed price meal and...my son had chosen the restaurant. Not much of a dessert person, I\u2019d hoped to decide if I wanted a dessert after the main meal, but \u2018no\u2019, was firmly advised it had to be ordered at meal commencement (OK, I spose). Within three minutes of ordering our (clearly pre-prepared) first courses were served. We\u2019d ordered a bottle of red and white and even though we\u2019d clearly said only a few of us were drinking, all had glasses placed in front of them and before we\u2019d noticed, everyone had a large glass of white poured, even though some of us wanted red. Waiter then grabbed six more glasses and loaded them up with red. So, there we were with two big glasses of wine before us. As members of our group concluded their first course, waiter whipped away their plates and looked impatiently at those of us still working our way through ours. A nano-second passed once first course was concluded before main course presented. Through this time, our waiter leaned over our shoulders to keep wine glasses topped up, even as we were saying \u2018no\u2019. Of course, dessert followed at world record time. All of us were astonished at the speed of this \u2018fine dining\u2019. I\u2019ve eaten at restaurants all over the world, and never have I experienced anything this insanely fast. We were in and out in just over an hour. Clearly, the restaurant had crammed in the seatings for the night. And, of course, many restaurants do just that. But at a certain point, if it is too rushed, that just becomes intolerable for the guests. \nThe final pleasure when we\u2019d left the restaurant and my husband stayed back to pay, was the compulsory 20 percent service charge, on top of the usual extra taxes.\nAll in all, an experience never to be repeated. Maximum cash extracted in minimum time. I notice this restaurant had been generally well-reviewed. And the food was OK though nowhere near great. But on this night at least, it felt like we were being fleeced.More"}
{"review":"Yes, this is a very good restaurant and the food and presentation are high caliber.  However, if you make a reservation (credit card required) and you must cancel  more than 24 hours ahead or they charge you.   Since the menu changes daily or every other...day, you don\u2019t know for sure what is being served   So you must wait to see it posted, and by then it\u2019s too late.  In our case, we didn\u2019t love the choices offered  1st course was a melon salad or tomato soup.  Meh. We paid extra for the rice which literally looked like cream of wheat and no, it was not risotto.  Salmon was delicious but it was the smallest piece that I had ever seen presented in a restaurant.  Beef was 4 thin 4inch slices.  So just go with the expectations that the food will be good, portions small and you may not get exactly what you really love.More"}
{"review":"I suggest you review the menu before going \u2026 it is a fixed menu with two options for each of three courses. We were able to order everything and share. First course corn soup was the star of the meal. The mushroom risotto was well...prepared. Our main course was a cod in a miso eggplant glaze (very good) and duck confit (really enjoyed). we enjoyed the dishes but we didn\u2019t care for the accompanying veggies. Our desserts did not disappoint and the winner was a pineapple ice cream served with macadamia nuts. Highly recommend as the service was very attentive.More"}
{"review":"Our first meal during our recent trip to California and Trestle chef and staff made it memorable. We arrived right on time for our Price Fixe dinner and we seated at a great table for people watching.  During our meal different servers took our order,...brought our food, and wine.  All were friendly, professional, and knowledgeable about the menu and wine list.  I started with the Falafel Salad which was dressed with a Tahini sauce that elevated it up several notches.  I had the short rib ragu cavatelli.  Even though I am not a huge mushroom fan, I only slightly tasted them.  The buttermilk biscuit cake with ice cream was delicious, but the French Press coffee was the perfect touch to end our meal.  We also liked the fact that there were so many great California wines on the wine list.  The only negative and reason for my refraining from giving an excellent rating is that the hostess sat a large family next to us a short time after we were seated.  The two children were young, loud, and very high maintenance.  Our date night was pretty much shot from then onward.  The mother of the two apologized to us 4 times and one of the servers did too.\n\nBut chef know that we loved your food!More"}

A great experience!More"}
{"review":"Amazing meal we had as we celebrated the end of our honeymoon. Trestle gives two options for every course, and the selection was reasonable. For $39 the three course gives great value for money, although we opted for the pasta course at $12 a head...(I had rock shrimp risotto which was amazing). Drinks soon get the bill moving too! They adapted the menu to distant requirements and did this with no fuss. Very very impressed.More"}

{"review":"We passed this bar on the way back to our hotel and decided to go in for some evening drinks. The cocktails were fine, nothing exceptional, but the issue came when we paid.\n\nWe paid by card and, as is normal in the US, they...present you with a receipt on which to write the tip, which they then take afterwards using the card that has already been authorised.\n\nThis bar took our receipt and decided to add an extra $10 onto their tip - we have the cardholder copy that proves the discrepancy.\n\nAll attempts to contact the bar subsequently have been ignored.\n\nDo not trust this establishment with credit \/ debit cards - if you must go, only pay with cash.More"}

{"review":"My experience at La Mar Cebicheria wqs one I will remember. We started with the Cebiche Cl\u00e1sico, which was very fresh and for sure one of the better ceviche dishes I\u2019ve had. I loved how the fish was sour, but had sweet potato to offset...it. However, the texture of the corn was slightly offsetting for me, because it confused me with Next, we got the Pulpo, which was my favorite dish and stood out tremendously to me. The octopus was amazing and tender by itself, but between the sweetness of the squash and crunch of the fava beans, it added some amazing flavors to the dish, especially when eaten with the octopus. Finally, we got the Lomo Saltado, this dish had some great flavors, but did not come with enough meat. I was sort of overwhelmed with the amount of potatoes, red onions, and tomatoes. However, did enjoy the sauce that was in the dish and the flavor in it. Overall, the dishes were excellent, but I found some of the dishes had a little too much potato. Although it was needed, the ratio of potato to dish could have been better. Overall, my experience at La Mar was amazing and will be remembered for a while.More"}

{"review":"We have dined here quite a few times when we have been visiting in SF.  Today everything was perfect!  It was lovely non-windy day in SF with puffy white clouds against a blue sky.  We sat on the patio which is such a treat as...you are able to look out at SF Bay.  It is also quieter than inside.  Our waitress, Fernanda, was cordial, efficient, and offered us perfect service throughout our meal.  But the food was the best ever!  I enjoyed Berejena Criollo which had eggplant, chutney and a mixture of fabulous flavors.  Hubby had chicken skewers (Anticucho de Pollo) which was incredibly flavorful and cooked to perfection.  We shared the Empe\u00f1ada sampler, and each had a glass of great wine.  I highly recommend this restaurant!  Today we did not have reservations (Sunday around 1:00), but I would suggest reservations because it can get busy.  Thank you for such a great meal!More"}

{"review":"We had a lovely lunch at Amber Indian restaurant. The hostesses and servers were charming. The food was delicious and reasonably priced. It was quite full for lunch and had a good vibe. The buffet was lovely and the same price as everything else. It...is in a good neighborhood of San Francisco.More"}
{"review":"While visiting San Francisco we had dinner at Amber India. It was the best Indian cuisine we have ever eaten. The food is flavorful, feels clean \u2014 not heavy and oily. Add to the incredible cooking the modern decor and it made for an amazing...experience. \nI have had Indian food in some of the most sophisticated cities in the world. Amber India is the best.More"}
{"review":"Convenient to the hotel and the people were nice, but the food was just not all that great. One person really liked theirs."}
{"review":"Clean place, good service, but it called my attention that the menu has only one dish with shrimp, and actually the menu is kind of small, compared to Hindu restaurants in Miami.  The food was good, great taste, portions reasonable, and prices were fine"}
{"review":"Not at all vegetarian friendly. Even worse, very poor customer service. The naan contains eggs. It was not announced anywhere on the menu that it does. Apparently \"Eggs are considered vegetarian\" it seems - since when? And the General manager made it worse by blaming...it - saying it was our fault that we did not ask. Everyone knows that Naan contains eggs. No customer has complained it seems. I saw boards announcing \"Gluten free\", \"Dairy Free\", \"Nuts free\" etc. But products containing eggs are not announced and if we have a question we need to ask apparently. What should we ask next - does your drinking water contain only H2o or anything else? We have to ask for every dish apparently and they are not responsible. I have never heard such preposterous comments and such a terrible customer service? Should we make a checklist next time and run that by for every dish we order at this restaurant? The GM said no one complained about eggs, and after 15 minutes of arguing he contradicted himself saying that recently in the past 2-3 weeks many customers are asking if these are egg free so he will mention to their owner about this and they cannot influence their cooks on how to make. No one is asking to change the menu. We are just asking that you be sensitive to customer requirements and announce what the product contains. I told them that people might not even be aware that it contains eggs. He said that whole wheat breads - like Rotis do not contain eggs and refined wheat breads like Naans contain eggs, but in one of their 5 branches, Naans also do not contain eggs. Seriously? We are supposed to be aware of all these? He made it worse by trying to offer a discount - this cannot make up for the disgust I went through today. I strongly recommend that if you are particular about vegetarian and no eggs avoid this restaurant. I would like to give this negative stars, less so for containing eggs and not announcing it, and more so for the insensitive way of handling customers. Absolutely disgusted. Will never visit this place againMore"}
{"review":"The lamb kebabs were generous in size and delicious.  Combined with the garlic naan bread and a great Malbec wine, my day was made!"}

After much wait we were told they ran out of cloth napkins! Upscale restaurant...runnng out of cloth napkins!! Never heard or seen before. It would have n=been better to give all paper napkins.More"}
{"review":"It's been a number of years since I've eaten Indian food in San Francisco primarily because I was worried it would disappoint. I've had such stellar experiences in London that San Francisco seemed like it could not live up to those experiences. I finally took...the plunge for a friend's birthday and went to Amber India on the recommendation of another friend. The food was very good. We ordered the samosas and a bread basket for the table. And I ordered the lamb chops. The lamb chops were excellent: beautifully marinated and then roasted in the tandoori oven.  I would have preferred them a little less well done, but I enjoyed them nonetheless. The service, however, was less than stellar. We ordered cocktails to start. The server opened up a bottle of wine which we had brought along. It was on the table and available so we sipped our wine. Appetizers were delivered. No cocktails. Time passed. Finally, I decided that I would forego the cocktails. What was the point? The server protested: they're being made! But agreed to cancel my cocktail. My friend still wanted his. Long story short. Entrees arrived, THEN his cocktail. I've never seen such a bizarre sequence of food and drink delivered to the table. In the end, no apology, no recognition even that there was something amiss. Also: corkage fee: exorbitant at $35. I'd go back, but I'd make sure the next server knew my expectations for service.More"}
{"review":"Had brunch before Aladdin on Sunday. The selection was great - breakfast, brunch, lunch and main course available. Service was great and had a delight time. The restaurant has indoor, downstairs and outside seating. \n\nBrunch starts at 10:30 on Sunday so ample time to get...to the theatre. I felt like I was back in Italy. Even was able to converse Italian with staff. \u2764\ufe0fTruly a welcoming experience. Highly recommend if you want a new place to try. It is across from Hotel Zetta, in between Market St and Mission on Mint. Hope to try again for lunch or dinner.More"}
{"review":"We were looking for a refreshing and quiet place for a dinner, to slow down and talk through the day. \n54 Mint was next to our hotel, but I would return even if my hotel was farther away. \nIn the last hours before close, we...were welcome, seated and attended quickly. Their kindness and attention was felt throughout - I really like the atmosphere of the place. \nThe food is simply fantastic! Rich, fresh, high quality, tradition and innovation combined. Prefect temperature, nicely presented, our waiter recommended us items that were not even in the menu. \nThe glass of Sicilian wine went well with my dishes. \nPricing is on the higher side, but completely worth it.More"}
{"review":"On a recent business visit a colleague and I ordered a pour of Kavalan at the bar. Our error was that we didn\u2019t specifically ask for the price, but assumed it would be along the lines of other similar single malts that were listed around...$20. Later at the dinner table the server offered specials for the evening including what sounded like an appetizer size black truffle whose price was also not shared but assumed that it would be a bit more expensive than other pasta dishes on the menu listed around $20s. When later on the bill the charges noted in the title came to be known, the server and the night manager advised they couldn\u2019t do anything. Upon writing later to the General Manager - Kenichiro Matsuura refunded $100 of the ~$270 charged. While he argued his position, didn\u2019t seem to hear what we were saying.\n\nExperience like this is unfortunate, leaves a sour taste and one wonders on what could have been done better? Something the management should reconsider.More"}
{"review":"Mint 54 has been a family favorite for us since we were first welcomed years ago. This is modern Italy, innovative dishes and some classics. Staff is always accommodating. The ambience inside or out is peaceful and enjoyable with a subtle vibe. This is where...we have had family events and the Italian branch of our family goes every visit. The Steaks are a trip to Tuscany, the lamb, the pastas and the glorious appetizers. Truly one of our favorites.More"}
{"review":"Went to eat by myself for dinner and they were able to squeeze me into the bar area. I ordered lamb chops, and they were without question the best lamb chops I've ever had. Solid wine list and the rest of menu looked great as...well, took some self-control not to return again! One downside was it was in the 40s and they kept the door open, so the bar area was a little chilly.More"}
{"review":"We ordered cocktails and apps. I told the waitress that my margarita was more ice than drink. It was literally 3 sips for $19 . The waitress ask me how the drink was and I responded by telling her it was more ice than drink....She said she would take care of me and bring another drink. She charged me for the other drink, which was also 3 sips (total of $38 for 6 sips)  and charged me $9 for extra bread that I did not order. I brought it up to the waitress and she told me the manager said \u201ctoo bad\u201d I was in a rush to get to another venue , so I had no time to argue. I tried to call but have not heard back.More"}
{"review":"Worst experience ever. \n\nMy best friend wanted to celebrate her birthday here - inviting 3 of us us.  However she's on a medical restricted diet.  Not able to eat but needs nutrients.  She wanted us to have a good time and eat - celebrate.  \n\nI...called a week in advance and spoke with Daniel and asked that that we would be celebrating her birthday but she could only have a bowl of hot water to put her dr prescribed powder in it.  \n\nDaniel called me back (I have the voicemail) and said it would be fine.  And then I spoke to him again and he said they would make her a birthday note too. \n\nWe arrived at the restaurant for her birthday Saturday 11\/19 and OMG. The manager on duty said 'no way' they could bring her a bowl of hot water.  'Outside food prohibited'\n\nHorrible.  We had to leave.  Ruined her birthday celebration.  \n\nWe ended up at another place down the street.  She got her bowl of hot water.  Not a problem. \n\nWe felt the manager was discriminating against her- so rude too.  \n\nTerrible and sad.  \n\nI have nothing positive to say about 54 MintMore"}
{"review":"This was our first time to 54 Mint and it was very nice. The service was excellent! We started with drinks, I had a cosmo and my husband had a Negroni. He'd never had one or Compari before and he doesn't like gin. Turns out...that he doesn't like Compari either. My cosmo was great. We shared the insalata di indivia and the suppli al telefono. The salad was nice. The croquettes were outstanding! The were the highlight of the meal for me. For entrees, I had the cacio e pepe and my husband had coda alla vaccinara. I hadn't had cacio e pepe before. It was really good but so rich that I couldn't finish it. It would be great as a side dish along with some protein. My husband loved the oxtail, he savored every bite. We also had an order of broccolini which was flavorful. For dessert we shared the budino al cioccolato. It was also nice. It's a rich chocolate cream and not too sweet. It seems like the Italian version of the French pot du creme.More"}
{"review":"54 Mint made this celebration very special. We reserved the downstairs grotto area and had the place to ourselves, the staff was attentive, everyone was served their food without any mishaps, they kept our drinks filled up, and made sure everyone was well fed and...watered. I would HIGHLY recommend this location for a special event. We were 25 people, but there was room for another 6 or so.More"}
{"review":"Honestly, we chose this restaurant due to proximity to our hotel, Hampton Inn. I saw the reviews were good, but didn't really read through them. Wow! One of the best meals we've had. Excellent. Our salads were fresh and flavorful, foccacia bread was delicious and...our meals (pasta carbonara and gnocchi) were amazing! Great wine selection. I wasn't hungry, but had to try one of their desserts and chose the tiramisu ... it didn't disappoint!\n\nBe sure to make reservations. We had 5 pm reservations due to a concert and I heard them tell people who arrived without reservations that they were booked.More"}
{"review":"We were a walk in and they seated us at the bar which was great because we could watch the bar tender work! The staff were really helpful and friendly and the atmosphere wasgreat too. The food was a little slow but the manager came...over to apologise to us which was a nice touch. The food was good quality and portions were big. The manager also helped us book a taxi to get us back to our apartment when we were finished.\nOverall an ejoyable visit, ThanksMore"}
{"review":"Really nice pasta spot in downtown area. Nice wine list, good cocktails. The cacio e Pepe was delicious! Perfect portion size for me maybe a little small for some. Great ambiance. Off the main tourist beaten path but still easy to get to by walking."}
{"review":"This was my second visit to 54 Mint and it was just as wonderful as the first visit. My friends were running the San Francisco Marathon and a delicious pasta dinner was in order for them. I opted for the BiSTECCA ai FERRI (picture added)...and it was amazing! It was cooked to perfection and I really didn't need to eat the whole thing but it was too good to pass up. The others ordered the GNOCCHi and it was also amazing. \n\nThe atmosphere is fantastic and this is a wonderful place for a date or a pre-show dinner. I highly recommend making a reservation. The cocktails are also very good. They have wonderful craft cocktails with a full bar with just about everything you could want. \n\nThere is very little parking near the restaurant but some public garages near by and if you use Spot Hero, you can get a much better rate than the standard rates.More"}
{"review":"The restaurant is popular and requires a credit card deposit upon reservations for cancellations within 24 hours.  I was looking forward to trying the restaurant before a matinee play at the Golden Gate.  Unfortunately too many cast had COVID and the play was cancelled within...24 hours of the reservations.  The Manager was extremely understanding and waived my cancellation fee.  As Broadway season ticket owners I'm looking forward to trying 54 Mint during the next performance.More"}

{"review":"Don\u2019t go. We spent nearly 100 dollars per person and got as an 8 course fixed menu: half a toast with avocado, spaghetti with ONE mussel, lettuce with dressing, potato salad, and half a scoop of strawberry sorbet. The rest was so so. Besides, you...eat all in the same plate with the same cutlery. Very overrated.More"}
{"review":"Never again. The worst tasting menu experience we've ever had. The dinner was over $100 per person. \nThe service and the level of attention was below average. \nExamples of dishes: tomatoe-cucumber salad (a couple of pieces per person), single oyster per person, pasta with corn,...pork that tastes like it's from Safeway. \nBesides, they returned one of our jackets with the labels cut off (looks like intentionally). We found out about it several days later. \nI don't recommend this place.More"}

{"review":"The two midwestern couples next to us thought we were food critics, since a constant stream of great dishes came our way. We had ordered the tasting menu. It was a true treat. Innovative flavors, beautiful plated and served with a lot of love. I...also really liked the venue, and all the other guests looked like college professors. The pork chops, the pasta, the salad, and especially the pavlova for dessert were delicious.

{"review":"Read about Frances in a news article and went on a Sunday night.  It's nicely, but simply, decorated a small place in the Castro with very small tables for two (which I hate) and noisy, but the meal was fantastic, service was good.  We had...the tasting menu, and everything was just outstanding.  The best things were probably the vegetables, the Little Gem salad was just outstanding, the pole bean appetizer was wonderful. The chickpea frites and the bacon beignets were great. The halibut was perfect and the steak was great.  Desserts were good.  The price ($65) for the tasting menu was appropriate and when I ordered cider, the server brought me a small amount of the prosecco my husband had ordered, to tide me over while the cider cooled.   The tasting menu is a lot of food, although portions weren't unduly large.More"}
{"review":"Frances is in my opinion one of the best restaurants in SF.  The food is exceptional and the service outstanding.  I love that it is small and very much a neighborhood restaurant.  They have a very good wine list and every server can help make...a selection if your not sure of what to order.  The menu changes quite often so if your a regular there is always something new on the menu.  I don't live in SF but visit often.  My son is a chef in SF and it's one of his favorite places so I get to dine here every time I come up.  Such a treat and can't wait for my next meal there.More"}
{"review":"Finally made it to Frances..... and enjoyed our dining experience there.  Casual setting, attentive and friendly service, good food.  Solid restaurant."}
{"review":"We were on vacation in San Francisco and had learned of the restaurant, Frances, through some friends of ours.  We had made a reservation, and when we got there, we were upgraded from a two-top to the four-top table by the window.  Wow!  We were...off to a great start.  (The restaurant is quite tiny and the two tops are really close to each other, so we felt like we had won the lottery!!)\n\nOur server (not Tara at this point) was a little on the \"not as friendly as one should be in this business\" side.  (Maybe she was not happy that the four top was now occupied by only two people instead of four.)  I might have downgraded Frances to a 4 due to the somewhat \"chilly\" service by our main server, but another server,Tara, a server in training for only her second day, saved the day!!!  She took SUCH great care of us, so much so that I asked before we left if I could have my picture taken with her!  (So, if you can request a server, ask for Tara.  You will know because her eyes are such a beautiful color.)\n\nOn to the food.  The food was fantastic!!  Here's the menu description of what we had (which changes daily):\n\nStarter:  Applewood Smoked Bacon Beignets with Maple Chive Cr\u00e8me Fraiche \n\nEntrees:\n\nHalibut - Blistered Snap Pea, Pearled Couscous, Sorrel Fumet, Spring Onion Cream\nAND\nGnocchi alla Romana - Maitake Mushroom, Summer Squash, Grana Padano, Basil Oil\n\nDessert:  Lumberjack Cake - Medjool Date, Stonefruit, and Coconut with a scoop of Brulee Ice Cream.  (THIS WAS A FULL BASES LOADED HOMERUN!  I would love, love, love to have the recipe.)\n\nI believe that a number of the recipes are inspired by the owner's grandmother and I think that the restaurant is named Frances, after the owner's grandmother.More"}
{"review":"Managed to get a reservation here after hearing how hard they are to come by.  Lovely though small out of the way restaurant.  Tables very close together, but part of the fun was seeing what everyone else was eating.  Delicious house wine although when we...asked for a glass of chardonnay, they came with a huge carafe and we drank it all!  By the ounce?  Were we supposed to stop drinking?  The bill for the wine was $32.40!  Hahaha!  We didn't know.  It was fine...  Food was innovative, generous and very tasty!!More"}

First of all, it is a small space, so naturally available table seating is limited. We opted for the $65. tasting menu and were...very glad we did. Everything was beautifully prepared and tasted delicious. Our server was attentive and helpful. We felt that our meal was well priced for such exceptional food.More"}

But yesterday I called to confirm a reservation because I could not remember what time I booked. The lady who answered was incredibly rude. She said not only did I...not have a reservation that night, but that I had never made a reservation there according to their records and based on my phone number. She said this while I was scrolling through perhaps a dozen previous reservation notifications with the same number I've had for years. She was belligerent and unbelievably confident for someone so wrong. I will still go back of course but it was a reminder of how important it is to have professionals working for you who know how to communicate and how not to piss of customers who've spent thousands of dollars with you over many years.More"}
{"review":"I actually cannot believe the positive reviews on this company. We came with 5 couples all celebrating our anniversaries. Pre-booked weeks in advance\u2026 Dressed up!

{"review":"The moment I walked in I used the adjective \"swank,\" which I later saw everyone uses, and for good reason. Located off a small alley, Bix has the delightful vibe of an urban supper club circa 1950 (not that I was born then, but based...on black-and-white movies.). I wouldn't have felt over dressed in a tuxedo or dinner jacket (not that anyone except waiters were wearing one.) The atmosphere cries out for a cocktail (or two), which are excellent, and afterwards, who cares whether the food is cutting edge? The menu, too, is a throwback to American cuisine pre-Julia Child. (I was surprised to find no steak on the menu, but there was a very good pork chop.) The wine list had some very nice Bordeaux and Burgundies at very reasonable prices. All-in-all a wonderful night on the townMore"}
{"review":"So refreshing to go to a restaurant that has not lost its attention to its guests, from a wonderful grand piano playing, to personal and profession waitstaff. And the food, absolutely spot on. The real deal for a great dining experience in San Francisco, no...shortcuts. Hard to say that about many of the formerly finer restaurantsMore"}
{"review":"Find out when they are open for lunch, you won't regret it. Try to sit upstairs with the view of the 19320ies bar and frescos. Very friendly and competent service and always good food. Interesting appetizers and choice mains. This is such a comfortable place...to sit, drink and talk.More"}
{"review":"We went to this restaurant after going there for a drink a couple years ago.  We figured we'd give it a shot.  I was pretty busy, and I will say the food was pretty good.  Nothing incredible, but pretty good.  The problem is they're short...staffed, and when you get there you feel like you're being rushed from the beginning.  In fact, we were told we were taking too long at the end, and we needed to make room for another table.  They have live music, but the problem is the schedule is inaccurate.  So we actually went there to hear some jazz and the saxophone player, but by the time we finally had to leave, he still had not started.  When you're spending this much money at a restaurant you don't want to feel rushed, and we did pretty much the entire time.  They just need to hire more people and I guess that's the problem, but we won't actually be back to see it.  Thanks.More"}
{"review":"Music was the highlight. Greeted by a not very friendly hostess. Server was very rushed. Had put on reservation it was my birthday and it was never acknowledged. Food was average. Would recommend for a drink at the bar but would not go back for...dinner.More"}
{"review":"BIX has long been on our radar. We had heard wonderful things but were a bit disappointed. First the positive. The atmosphere, music, service,and cocktails are amazing. You literally feel like your in the heart of the roaring 20\u2019s. One of the best atmospheres I...have encountered in a restaurant in some time. \n\nSadly, the quality of the food, especially for what they are charging for it, is severely lacking. \n\nWe started with the \u201cTruffled Cheese \u201cCroques\u201d. Sounds wonderful! But in reality they cut up a grilled cheese sandwich with some caramelized onions inside and it was very dry. For our mains we had the BIX chicken hash and House Made Spaghetti. The hash was simply two fried chicken patties, like something you find in a school cafeteria, in a rather good cream sauce. The spaghetti lacked any kind of real flavor and was rather bland. We also ordered whipped mashed potatoes as a side. They had absolutely no seasoning or flavor\u2026.simply potatoes whipped up. No butter, salt\u2026..nothing. \n\nSo, we were very disappointed with the food. Again, the atmosphere, service and cocktails were outstanding. Maybe it was an off night for them, no idea. However, we would likely not return\u2026.unless it was just for drinks.More"}
{"review":"Every time we visit San Francisco we book here, not disappointed \nGreat atmosphere with live music, I love the bustle and the ambiance of this stunning restaurant \nFood delicious as usual and staff efficient and helpful \nRoll on the next time"}
{"review":"Went here for my Birthday as it has Jazz music and write ups sounded fantastic. Restaurant is lovely, but in 1920's not so many people would have been crammed in, so very noisy and could not hear group playing which was a shame. The food...was cooked well and nicely presented. Service was okay but my partner had plate taken while I was still eating so not as high class as you would expect for price payingMore"}
{"review":"BIX is a hidden gem in San Francisco's financial district. If you are looking for a place to dine with class, but without the exorbitant cost, this is it. The ornate bar, wall-length mural, and piano jazz provided an ambience of the Roaring Twenties. Food...and service were outstanding\u2014order the Gold St. Foster (Bananas Foster) for dessert!More"}
{"review":"A great experience and romantic restaurant. Great for a special occasion or date. It\u2019s quite expensive but very busy. The food is delicious particularly the fish and steak. Good cocktails too. Expect to pay $45 for a plate of dinner and also note they add...6% SF offset to the bill to cover staff healthcare. The experience and architecture is stunning. Live music is great.More"}
{"review":"Tightly run operation with impeccable attention to detail, crisp service, and superb food. My wife and daughter loved the 1930s vibe and live jazz piano. I appreciated the little things: glassware choice and frequency of ice water refresh, warm and fresh buns with butter at...the right temperature, cutlery placement, temperature of red wine served by the glass, etc. Cocktails: the Paloma and Gold Street were both excellent. The food: fried chicken was a home run, I wanted to lick the dish clean; potato pillows fluffy and delicious; steak really meshed well with the the cooked onion and broccolini; cod creamy and light. Highly recommended.More"}
{"review":"Had been recommended to go here by someone who went a few years back. Had the waffle, eggs Benedict and a corned beef sandwich. Eggs were not runny, which was a bit of a reflection of the overall standard. It was ok, nothing special and...there was nothing that would make me want to hurry back given the prices.\nService was again, ok- nothing to should out about.More"}
{"review":"Had breakfast and an evening snack here. Friendly efficient service and tasty food - has a 60's vibe so how much you enjoy the place depends on your love of formica. Food good if not 'fine'."}
{"review":"Sounds good, but disappointing.  Not a restaurant, more a diner. Formica tables, plastic menus, no atmosphere or intimacy.  Food was OK, but nowhere near the \"fine food\" in their name.  Service was OK."}
{"review":"Tasty food but nothing especially amazing about it. The eggs benny was good, but the portions are small for the price. Service was fine. My husband liked that ingredients are folded into the eggs instead of dumped in the middle of his omelet."}
{"review":"Very quick service and delicious food! \n\nHighly recommend. We ordered both pancakes and egg muffin with salmon"}
{"review":"We spent our first morning in San Francisco looking around, unsuccessfully, for a decent breakfast around Fisherman\u2019s Wharf. On the second morning we took a cable car to Union Square and checked out Trip Advisor\u2019s best rated restaurant Sears Fine Foods. We were not disappointed....We had a brilliant breakfast with impeccable service while chilling in the beautiful surroundings. The restaurant was almost full but we didn\u2019t have to wait long the food and the coffee top ups.\nIt was so good we went back every opportunity we had.More"}
{"review":"Amazing breakfast, every part of it done perfectly and a great atmosphere by the bar. Great service and feels like a must visit on a busy day in SanFran"}
{"review":"Looking for some good diner style food at a San Francisco mainstay restaurant?  Then this is the spot!  I was here YEARS ago, and my friends and I popped in for a late lunch.  Service was attentive, the menu extensive and they have that old...diner vibe but sort of in an upscale way given they serve drinks.  Sure, you will pay more than you would normally for a salad or sandwich but if you are in this area, you are likely touristing.\n\nThe Swedish pancakes are a must if you are a pancake fan, everything else on the menu we ordered tasted fresh\/great.More"}
{"review":"My husband and I from Canada and my sister and her family from the UK met up in San Francisco and had many meals together.  Our dinner at Sears Fine Foods was by far our favourite.  We all thought our meals were excellent!   A really...great restaurant.   Wish we lived closer!More"}
{"review":"I had breakfast here a couple of days on a recent trip to San Francisco. This is an old restaurant that has been in the same location for many years. I thought the food was good and the service was very quick and friendly."}
{"review":"The food was great and the staff very friendly. It was so good that we went back the next day for breakfast again."}
{"review":"The line is repeatedly out the door, yet the time goes by fast. And you'll be shocked at how much space there actually is in this place... can't tell from the outside. My friend had heard of it so we walked from hotel to check...it out. Wish I had written sooner so I could remember full details. I do remember having eggs benedict and home fries... the healthy serving of eggs, bacon, sourdough toast and pancakes my friend had (and shared). My biggest suggestion is to go through the picture gallery and get some ideas. I saw the eggs benedict looking like they had a florentine option that I don't remember seeing on the menu (doesn't mean it wasn't there). Going in with a craving sometimes takes the experience up another notch. This place already has plenty of notchs. It'll be on my list next San Fran visit. In fact I'm referring to a friend who's going this month.\n2 BURPS UP!!!More"}
{"review":"This restaurant was recommended to us, so we went for breakfast. It was a popular spot as quite busy.  Options for breakfast were plentiful and we were served quickly and drinks given to us.  Food arrived in good time, presentation of food was also good....Food was hot and very tasty.  We had eggs Benedict with toast as side extra and I had a full breakfast with poached eggs.  Reasonably priced.More"}
{"review":"Very good and professional service. Chocolate mousse cake was tasty. Espresso was good.\nI liked the old decor."}
{"review":"Went for Sunday breakfast. Short line when we got there (approx 11am), longer line when we left (12:30). More than meets the eye. They also have downstairs seating and waiters seem to do just as good a job of getting food to you hot from...kitchen upstairs. Really enjoyed smoked salmon Benedict.More"}
{"review":"Nice business lunch in the Wayfare Tavern in the financial district. We sat outside which was pleasant. Food was good as was the service."}
{"review":"Actually just wanted a burger whilst in the area and my husband picked it out - expected a bar so bit surprised to find an upscale, business dinner type setting!   Beautiful restaurant and staff were super attentive. Wasn\u2019t expecting how delicious the burger was -...satisfied that craving and ended up being a great last meal of our San Francisco vacationMore"}
{"review":"The dishes were excellent, the waitress super kind : all was perfect from A to Z. We tried the mussels, the burger and the Caesar Salad. Wonderful"}
{"review":"Great place for a business meeting, service was good, food tasty and I had some good service despite the food taking a little bit long to come out, overall lovely place to have a business Linch would recommend"}
{"review":"Attentive and friendly service. \n\nPrices are a bit high for the fare offered. \n\nShrimp cocktail was perfect in every way. \n\nThe fried chicken was cooked well and very juicy but lacked adequate seasoning. \n\nThe cauliflower was nothing short of spectacular with great flavor. Wow!\n\nDeserts...were OK.More"}
{"review":"Casual yet upscale bistro, with very interesting items. We started with Deviled Eggs and Burrata Toast, both had tasty twists and our table loved them. The Burger and the Fried Chicken seem to be the favorites so we dived into those - very good. The...menu had enticing sides but the meals themselves were quite generous in portion. The restaurant is quite noisy so not best for intimate meal and the wine list is rather pricey. The highlight was our server Ginger, who was knowledgeable, personable and a delight. She\u2019s the type of employee that makes customers make a return visit, which we will!More"}
{"review":"Great gourmet food! We went for lunch.  Came back for dinner. Great staff and service. Had the club sandwich with salad fries etc.  Also burger and other in the evening."}
{"review":"The wait staff and kitchen staff were very helpful and accommodated my temporary diet limitations. As a solo diner, I was offered seating inside the dining room or at the chef\u2019s table. I opted for the latter and throughly enjoyed watching \u201cthe choreographed dance\u201d in...kitchen. Truly amazing to observe.\n\nThe braised short ribs were tasty, moist, and fell off the bone.\n\nI will certainly return again when I am available to try additional menu items.More"}
{"review":"I didn\u2019t really know what to expect with this place as my husband had picked it - with eyes set on getting the burger. I wasn\u2019t hungry enough for all that so I opted for one of their appetizer salads (it was delightful and creative,...which is hard to do with a salad) and my husband got the burger. I tried his and it was so rich - but great! We sat at the bar overlooking the kitchen which is always fun but you can sit at the regular bar as well. You can certainly tell they take pride in their service as we were well attended to. We ordered two cocktails and they were both lovely; we were there during the brunch hour so I can\u2019t speak to the prices for dinner but I thought they were reasonable considering the ambiance. The vibe makes you feel like you should be better dressed but we were wearing verrrry casual clothes and it was fine!More"}
{"review":"Great historical ambiance. Great cocktails. Ask them about the bricks. Food was excellent as was the service, thank you Ginger. Music was a bit loud for conversation so they even obliged when we requested a reduction in the volume. A historical gem. Looking forward to...next visit.More"}
{"review":"We came here to celebrate my daughter's 30th birthday and it was a pleasure from start to finish.  We had a 6:00 reservation and were seated as soon as we walked in the door.  Our wait staff were exceptional - very attentive and informative, and...Mei, our server was also excellent - she was always there and never intrusive. The meal which included salmon, gem salad with fabulous Green Goddess dressing, a burger and short ribs were perfectly cooked and presented.  We also had a very nice choice of beverages to choose from.  And I can't not mention the POP-OVERS!! To die for!  We finished the evening with a nice macaroon with a candle for my daughter and lovely desserts.  This is definitely a special occasion perfect destination!More"}
{"review":"Great atmosphere, great food and a fabulous selection of wines - in a business district a real break from the corporate world with friendly service and great food.  The chef's counter is much recommended for seating!"}
{"review":"Not a bad place, however the burgers we received were very greasy. Couldn\u2019t fault anything else though, good service. Nice pub."}
{"review":"Stopped for some small bites and drinks.\nPlace had a bit og an upscale feeling, but without being to posh.\n\nStaff was friendly, food was good and i got a couple of good beers. What more can you ask for?"}
{"review":"We took five staff members to this restaurant and got a good sampling of the menu.  The starters, squash soup was excellent.  Also good was the Caesar salad.  For the entrees, the fried chicken and pork shops were standouts.  Also good was the salmon and...burger.  Their popovers were amazing.  Also good were the cocktails and a decent but small wine list.  Deserts were also good.  Service was average.More"}
{"review":"If you are feeling foot weary, or wanting to make your birthday special with close friends, or want an intimate moment, you have chosen well by dining here. The atmosphere is soothing & uplifting; you feel immediately welcome and at peace with the world. There...are several different atmospheres to be had, all of them like a wonderful mist surrounding one with graciousness & joy. (If you like the impressionist painting by Manet called \u201cA Bar at the Folies Bergere, you will feel as if you have stepped into it). For those of us who recall the \u2018old school\u2019 Herb Caen restaurant world, Le Colonial celebrates this, with white tablecloths, twinkling glasses, an open atmosphere, and above all incredibly kind waiters, who treat you as if you\u2019ve been coming there for years. Even though there are not too many options for a vegetarian, it really doesn\u2019t matter, because you come here to enjoy and to participate in the moment, to be a part of the painting. My one light note: please rethink the spring roll, which ought to be as light and airy and crisp as the lovely silk lanterns in your hallway. The lychee fruit dessert is to die for & I ached to adopt the charming coffee pot. As a little girl, who went to Jack\u2019s, a nearby restaurant which sadly has vanished, Le Colonial has similar hints of this French elegance\u2026so take your child here instead: they will be equally awed.More"}
{"review":"I would love to write a better review, but unfortunately, the wait was abysmal, and we had to leave before our food was served.  We had tickets to hear Michelle Obama at 8 pm, and were excited to make reservations at le colonial.  Reservations were...for 545, and unfortunately, due to traffic, we arrived at 6 pm, after calling to let them know, and being told \"no problem\".  I had asked for \"outdoor\" dining (COVID), and were initially seated in the upstairs glass covered greenhouse type area with overhead heaters--perfect for dining and feeling slightly safer than indoors.  We were seated at a table where the overhead heater wasn't working, and were quickly moved to an adjacent table when we requested it.  We were fairly quickly asked about water choices of tap vs carbonated.  That was the end of our service.  We waited for 30\" before flagging a waiter to order drinks and because they were so busy (and obviously short staffed), we placed our entire order at that time.  After another wait, our appetizer (imperial crab rolls...,quite delicious).  Still no cocktail, but we were assured the drinks would eventually arrive, which they eventually did.....and I enjoyed the tamarind margarita and hubby a glass of wine.  Then more and more wait.  Because we needed to get to the Masonic auditorium, when no meal had shown up 1 hr and 40 minutes after we had first arrived, I spoke with the hostess.  I indicated that we needed to leave and wanted to pay.  Profuse apologies from the hostess, who shared that the  kitchen was quite busy.  The check eventually arrived and we paid, with a generous tip for the wait staff who clearly were doing the best they could.  The hostess indicated that the chef profusely apologized.  When I asked if we might have a complementary meal in the future, I was assured that the chef would contact me.  While it's possible I missed a return call, there were no voice messages.  As noted, I was very much looking forward to the evening and the meal.  Two hours should have been plenty of time for a meal.  I would strongly suggest that le colonial not accept any more reservations than can be handled by the existing staff...wait staff and kitchen.  I'm ambivalent about eating there again.More"}
{"review":"Food was good! But beer was late, had to ask for it. Didnt taste as it should, and found debris in it. Wine was fine an rest of service was good."}

{"review":"The food was very good. We had imperial spring rolls, swordfish and one of the beef dishes, Brussels sprouts as a side.  Portions were very large and meant to be shared.  Decor and ambiance are very nice.  But service was VERY slow.  Our wine arrived...20 minutes after we ordered, and order sent to kitchen 31 minutes after we arrived.  At 65 minutes after our reservation, I complained to the receptionist at the front, We had our food within minutes with apologies from the server.  We were told our order was put in front of others.   Chef came out to apologize. It appeared that they were very short-staffed and did not alter the number of tables they filled. I would go back, but not until staffing problems are resolved. One note, restaurant is under new management and menu on Trip Advisor is not accurate at all.More"}
{"review":"We had the family dinner for four and every dish was delicious.  Ambiance and service were fine.  Easy to share a meal and talk--not noisy!"}
{"review":"So so happy with our experience there and I hope people read this. We had our wedding at Le Colonial after two failed attempts; not our initial intent to have it here, but with changes one adjusts I suppose :). Michelle and team were so...so so incredibly attentive, caring, helpful, incredible we were overwhelmed. They helped us organize everything on our (modified) special day and made us feel welcomed. Equally importantly to the average person on here; the food was excellent. Everything was very well made including the beef, fish, spring rolls, papaya salad and otherwise. As a standalone restaurant I would give it five stars between the food and the service; with our unique circumstance, we could not praise this place highly enough.More"}
{"review":"I don't remember the year of my first visit to the Le Colonial but I know that it has been more than 15 years and I've loved every meal. When I'm thinking about going out for a nice dinner for two, this is always a...go-to. You cannot miss when you order any of their house specials- and don't forget the dry-fried string beans.More"}
{"review":"Nice location and pretty building. That\u2019s it pretty much. They don\u2019t deliver to the table a meal that you would expect based on the the impression you get from the venue. To be fair, the service was good and the appetizer they suggested not bad....We were four people and every single one of us had a mediocre entree.More"}
{"review":"We definitely enjoyed our dinner here. We started with the Buddha rolls. Nicely presented and flavored. My husband ordered the sesame crusted ahi, and I  ordered the Sea bass in banana leaves. And coconut rice. Everything was delicious. Will definitely return."}
{"review":"We came here on the recommendation of my Sister. She and I are foodies and excellent cooks so I had fairly high expectations.  I don\u2019t know if we were there on an off night, or my Sister just doesn\u2019t know Vietnamese flavors. The sauce with...the crab roll was very good but the sesame tuna main course was in a cloying Chinese style sauce with a tom of vegetables. I love vegetables but there were no herbs or flavors of Vietnam no sense of the lightness and bright  flavors I hoped for.   Atmosphere and service were both fine. The menu is tired.More"}
{"review":"A must for SF dining bucket list. The service is very good and the food is delicious. The low lighting and linens makes it feel slighttly upscale, but we were very comfortable. The BRUSSEL SPROUTS! If we had ordered a table full of those we...would be satisfied. We shared garlic noodles, spring rolls, crab noodles, chicken curry, and delicious wines.  Everything was good. Chicken curry broth had a spicy kick, very lovely rich broth.More"}
{"review":"We ate here for our Thanksgiving dinner this year as we were in from out of town.  The food was amazing and the service was impeccable.  The restaurant felt a little cozy with the tables being close together but once you got seated and started...eating, you didn't notice.  I highly recommend!More"}
{"review":"At Le Colonial, they serve French Vietnamese cuisine.\n\nOne reason we chose this restaurant is that it is close to the Inn at Union Square. The setting of Le Colonial is romantic. As you walk through the door, you feel as though you traveled back...in time to the tropical elegance of the 1920's French colonial Vietnam. You can almost feel the sway of palm trees and glow of candles. It evokes an ambiance of lush French colonial Vietnam.\n\nThe menu showcases authentic Vietnamese cuisine with a touch of French influence.\n\nOur server Soleda made some great suggestions. We enjoyed fresh spring rolls and crispy rolls as a starter that were both delicious. Keith then had Bo Luc Lac, which is Wok-seared Filet Mignon cubes, and Tina had a sauteed tofu dish. Both were creatively done and tasted great. With our dinner, we had an amazing Flora Spring Napa wine. We finished off the meal with a marvelous dessert for two called Le Colonial Bananas Roties. \n\nEverything was amazing!!!!More"}
{"review":"I was fan of Le Colonial food going to NY rest usually 3 times per year. San Francisco one was similar 5 yrs ago and now excited with the opp to go again this year, It was so regular so standard so far away from...being a sparkling place but with same high price than balance price\/quality went down. Seriously so many places better than I would not waste my time and life going thereMore"}
{"review":"Five colleagues and I walked to Le Colonial during a business trip. The restaurant was located down a side alley, so we laughed about it being \"hidden\" and it actually was a hidden gem. The servers were attentive, but gave us time to enjoy our...conversation and meal. We all enjoyed an appetizer plate, drinks, and entrees that included lemongrass chicken, halibut, pork shoulder, prawns and garlic noodles, and fried rice. Everyone really enjoyed the experience. With tip, the meal was $502.More"}

{"review":"Visiting SF for the first time and craving some Latin cuisine we ventured forth to Lolo. Wait time was reasonable and the place was packed for a Wednesday night. Service was wonderful. Drinks are well balanced and flavorful and the food was outstanding! We had...the quesadilla birria which was so juicy and delicious. The Pork carnitas were exceptional. We even tried the crickets which were a tasty adventure we would do again.More"}
{"review":"The food was good but average, for prices above average.   The place was very noisy and with loud music of poor choice (weird punky? world music, hard to tell with the noise).  The bill had an extra \"special\" charge we did not catch, presumably for...returning a glass of wine that was badly oxidized.  For $50+ per person I expected much better, and will not be returning.More"}
{"review":"Had visited Lolo in Guadalajara and they had mentioned they had one in San Francisco.  We loved it so much in Mexico that we made it a point to visit while in the city.  We were blown away with the food even though the menu...differs a little from the one in Mexico. We live in Southern California and are used to good Mexican food.  Fantastic flavors, funky great ambiance and superb service.  We visit San Francisco often and have made this a must on every visit.  I saw some reviews that mention the price and value but to us, that just seems to be typical of SF.  All good meals were pricey.More"}
{"review":"This was one of our favourite dining experiences in San Fran. Bustling on a Tuesday night, we lucky to have reserved a table. Excellent Mexican tapas with excellent service!"}
{"review":"Excellent Mexican place, even if it was a decent taxi ride out from the centre. Inventive, good quality food, nice atmosphere, and quality drinks. I wish there was one in London !"}

{"review":"Don't get me wrong. Food was good, Service was good, But portions were far below what you would expect in this price range. I realize it is San Francisco, but there has to be a limit.\n\nI had the fried avocado tacos and they were...good. But they are so tiny, like all of the tacos served here, No one in our party complained about the quality of the food, just the lack of it.\n\nI chose this restaurant based on reviews here, and was disappointed with the outcome. \n\nMargaritas had almost no alcohol, or so it seemed.\n\nI don't think I would return.More"}
{"review":"Great fod in a great atmosphere. A fantastic combination of Latin and American style. Service excellent"}

Delicious fresh food, amazing drinks and great atmosphere. Definitely worth seeking out when in SF.More"}

If ever back in SF I'll go backMore"}

{"review":"Happened to stumble upon this restaurant by accident when on vacation, saw a fairly large line of people outside down the street so we went to check it out.  Was able to get a table for 2 fairly quick, was right away impressed with the...historic feeling and atmosphere inside this old building.  Had one of the best steak dinners I have ever had anywhere.  Ended up going 2 nights in a row I enjoyed the experience so much.  This place gets busy and by reading the comments it could maybe be considered noisy to some, I really enjoyed the positive high energy atmosphere here.  Whenever I return to San Francisco again I will always come back here.  The staff was amazing and the manager was a super nice guy who was great to talk to.More"}

I couldn't fault a thing, and was fascinated by the waiters running upstairs with trays full of meals, and the fast table-clearing to accommodate the next diners.\n\nWould absolutely recommend!More"}

Was hurried in by a hostess who didn\u2019t mind slating a business over the street. \nWas put into a very small booth with hardly any room. \nGiven glasses of water, and bread...which may be customary but went to waste. \nMenu was small to choose from\nOrdered New York steak for husband and chicken for me. The chicken was in breadcrumbs and I asked for no sauce and it didn\u2019t have hardly any taste.  The chips were crispy and hard. My husbands steak wasn\u2019t cooked to preference either. \nStaff were nice especially our server. \nOverall the food wasn\u2019t worth what we paid for it. And wouldn\u2019t go back.More"}
{"review":"We booked. We were asked if a special occasion- we were celebrating 20 years married last week. We\u2019d decided to have one big meal out to celebrate whilst in san fran and we thought that John\u2019s would be a good place. Thought they\u2019d make a...bit of a fuss. \n\nFood was good. Cocktails good but it all felt a bit rushed. \nOur bill was over $200 and at end of meal - thank you and good night. Nothing special. Pity as I\u2019ve read reviews that say how special they make you feel.More"}
{"review":"One of the most important things about being away is finding a good place to eat.\nI fell upon John's by accident but I'm sure glad I did. From the off the staff were friendly and helpful and the steak was perfect. Now, if someone...feeds me well, I'm likely to go  back again. And that's just what I did, by the end of my stay I was on fist bumping terms with the guy on the door!  Also, when I turned up with a queue snaking down ghe Street, they sneaked me in and sat me at the bar.\nThe food was excellent, I have no complaints at all and the staff did everything to make this a great dining experience!More"}
{"review":"Our family all had a great steaks on a last minute Sunday night reservation. Glass of Pinot noir was really good as was our dessert. The old school vibe was welcome as well. The host was super friendly!"}
{"review":"Four stars?\n\nGreat restaurant, lovely welcome by the male greeter. He used my name and was equally pleasant when I  left.\n\nFillet mignon, carrot, not carrots, green beans, mash with a parmigiana sauce. Outstanding!\n\nFour stars?\n\nOrdered Pecan pie enriched with bourbon as my sweet....Took an eternity to come and no taste of bourbon, hence Four stars.\n\nBoth floors full, great busy restaurant and I'm pleased I've been.\n\nThank you Team John's GrillMore"}
{"review":"What a lovely old restaurant. Great welcome. Shown to my table. Anchor Steam on draught. Went for the shrimp cocktail then the burger. Really first rate. Recommend booking."}
{"review":"The chicken Tinga tacos were the best I\u2019ve ever had.  Corn tortillas were freshly made and the chicken was cooked on an open fire.  The server was quick and friendly!  I highly recommend this place!"}
{"review":"Great service and great food. We are from New Mexico so have a ton of experience with Mexican food. It was a great lunch as we spent the day in town."}
{"review":"We were here for dinner on a Friday evening. The place was packed. The food was excellent & the service was quick and warm."}
{"review":"We had a delicious late lunch here on a Tuesday.  Lovely seating in the open air\/sidewalk.  Snack of cucumber and jicama was unique but lacking flavor.  Would have preferred free standard salsa and chips. Great fish tacos. Loved the halibut crudo. Excellent service!"}
{"review":"Bold authentic foods, with wonderful selections on the menu. Great vegetarian options and the sauces that were all homemade and so good.\nIf you're looking for a margarita this is one of the best I've had. Got this off with amazing customer service and great...location, I'll definitely be back.More"}
{"review":"Excellent Mexican cuisine served in a small but somehow spacious  place. Lines are long so make reservations ahead of time.  The food is close to authentic and really is tasty and savory. The service here however is sus.  Sometimes you get noticed by the wait...staff and other times they walk right by your hand in the air.More"}
{"review":"We stopped for lunch here, opposite the ferry, before returning to San Francisco. The service was good as was the food- would recommend the beef taco."}
{"review":"A lovely restaurant located near the Sausalito waterfront. The food was delicious - I recommend the fried pork belly tacos, served with picked red onions, mole, and cilantro. Friendly staff and reasonably priced."}
{"review":"Just a two minute walking distance from Above the Tide Inn, this was the perfect dinner choice for us. Had we stayed longer in Sausalito we would have returned for a second meal, it is that good! We had fish tacos, Baja style cod and...Al Pastore. The brussels sprouts are the best I have ever had! Beautiful night to sit outside and Elizabeth was an excellent server, friendly, attentive and offer the best suggestions. We took everyone of them and were not disappointed.More"}
{"review":"Crazy great Mexican food from a family that spends 5 months a year in Mexico. The carnitas and tinga chicken - wowowowow!  Great service and stellar tequila selection as well, even hard to find uniques. Love the J\u00edcama and cukes w Taj\u00edn. Ask for them...w guac as well!!More"}
{"review":"Amazing gluten free lunch.  Everything on the menu is gluten free.  We had an empanada appetizer that was delicious.  The tacos were also great.  Wish we were hungrier."}
{"review":"Great pit stop for a couple of tacos, some warm fresh chips and salsa and a couple of cold Lagunitas IPA\u2019s sat on the patio watching the world go by. Flavoursome and nice service."}
{"review":"Highlight of this place was the Bloody Mary\u2019s and Sangrias. Should\u2019ve asked for the recipe for the sangrias because they were soooo good. \nThis place was humming on a Sunday afternoon. Sun shining. Lots of people. Buzzing with weekend trade. Centrally located near the ferry...arrival\/departure pier.\nWe dined inside but there is an option to dine alfresco. \nTacos were on our hit list but they are very different to what we are used to in Australia. I ordered chicken and my partner had pulled pork. We found the soft taco shell was neither deep fried and crusty or soft dry as in a flour tortilla but it was flat and over oily. Plenty of filling which meant we had to eat much of the contents before being able to pick it up and wrap it to eat it. Not what we are used to but seems how they are prepared here.\nDisability access was good. Parking easily available across the road. Dietaries catered for if you liaise with staff. High chairs available. Dogs allowed. Toilets clean.\nStaff were excellent. Fast and efficient and also lovely to have a chat to. \nWell worth a visit, especially if you\u2019re from the USA where you\u2019re familiar with this style of food.More"}
{"review":"We only had an hour between tour groups so took the recommendation from Tower Tours to eat at Copita Tequileria.  FABULOUS!  The food was delicious, & considering how the restaurant was packed, came quite fast.  We sat at the bar on the recommendation from the...host & enjoyed the warm & efficient staff doing a superb job.  The combination of yummy food & excellent service make this restaurant a real find.  We only wish we'd had more time to enjoy more selections - next visit!More"}
{"review":"We had their fish tacos which were excellent. And their tamales were good but came only  with chicken.  They provide spicy cucumbers and jicamas as an option to chips and salsa. The service was efficient with some open air tables.  And the location in the...heart of downtown next to the SFO ferry can't be beat.More"}
{"review":"Holy cow, this place was delicious! You must try a soup in a bread bowl! My group also had crab cakes, a burger and dungeons crab\u2026 all amazing!"}
{"review":"Sat at the bar and enjoyed a lovely bowl of French onion soup! Hubby had tomato in a sourdough bread bowl. Great choice of wine and good service"}
{"review":"We visited here several times while visiting Fisherman's Wharf and San Francisco. \n\nEverything we had off the menu was amazing and there was nothing to fault with service, cleanliness, value for money. Everything was 5 stars. This is how a restaurant should operate. Take note...all of you on Pier 39.\n\nIf you want a lovely meal, made with great ingredients and served by amazing staff, then Boudin is your place.More"}
{"review":"We looked at the downstairs cafe, but it was very crowded, so decided to go to the Bistro upstairs. We did not get a very good welcome from the staff member at the desk, he seemed disinterested, but after a short wait we were shown...to a nice table with view of the harbour. We both had chowder in bread. I had a very good nonalcoholic cocktail. The place was quite busy and a bit noisy.More"}
{"review":"Lovely place!  Great views!  The crab & corn bisque in the sourdough bread bowl was great!  For my entr\u00e9e, I had the filet mignon with creamed spinach and mashed potatoes, it was delicious!  Our waitress was super!"}
{"review":"Bistro Boudin continues to be a top choice in San Francisco where the food is delicious and the views are unparalled.  \nThe Fried Calamari is a perfect choice to start the meal as the Calamari is cooked to perfection where the squid is not overcooked...and the amount of batter does not overwhelm the natural taste of the calamari.  Though the restaurant provides a generous portion of the in house freshly baked sourdough bread, it is hard to pass up one of the man bread bowl options.  The clam chowder is a favorite and is only rivaled by their corn and crab bisque.  Though not their specialty, the salads are also quite tasty and generous with very fresh ingredients.   Though the highlight is the food, it is hard to challenge the amazing views that patrons will receive enjoying the view of the vast Pacific and more importantly, the beauty that is know as Alcatraz Island!  The service is also very good with servers who are attentive but not disruptive.  \nBistro Boudin is a perfect choice for food, atmosphere and service!More"}
{"review":"Basic food. We had pizza. Nice, but sparing topping with significantareas of nothing. Service was good. Setting was lovely. Reasonably priced."}
{"review":"Bistro Boudin, has a bakery downstairs as well as quick, fast food type service.  We had the pasties which were AMAZING!  \n\nThey also make much of the sourdough bread served in fisherman\u2019s wharf.\n\nGo upstairs and eat at the Bistro.  \n\nGreat bar, views in the...dining room are fantastic.  Very nice restaurant.  Food is good and service is great.More"}
{"review":"Had to visit here and was not disappointed.  Great fish and chips which is an accolade from a Brit!! Clam Chowder in sourdough was a great size portion and glad we got to try this."}
{"review":"What a rip off.  Do not go upstairs and sit at a table.  Sandwich is more expensive and chowder is more expensive.  Stand in line and get it downstairs, there are tables. Thought this would be good and ate there first night, worst claim chowder...of our stay in SF and even the bread bowl was not as good.  To many other places to go.More"}
{"review":"Excellent food and service! We sat in the bar area and the server was the bartender. Treated us like gold. Thanks for a great San Francisco experience!"}
{"review":"This is a great place to eat while in the Fisherman's Wharf area so you can try clam chowder or other seafood. Either eat here or Boudin Cafe downstairs which is more casual. If you like chowder you should order the clam chowder in a...sourdough bowl but if you are not a chowder fan, don't worry. There are lots of other options- many of them with sourdough bread. After you have eaten take a moment to look around the bakery and gift shop downstairs and you will see lots of cute gifts, tons of animal shaped sourdough bread (you can buy these too!) and even a moving track of baskets of bread going around the shop by the ceiling. Very cute and creative here!More"}
{"review":"The food and service was good. However if you are not a seafood lover then options are limited. It was worth it for the experience though! If the weather allows it, ask to sit outside."}
{"review":"Make sure you ask your server for their favorites, we did and loved everything we ordered!! We shared the cioppino that was recommended and all of us also ordered the sourdough bread bowls of corn chowder and the tomato basil. We awere a family of...4 with teens. Then the all you can eat bread..oh my gosh sooo good. Our server was also awesome and beyond helpful. Loved this place 10\/10 totally recommend!!More"}
{"review":"Didn't have reservations but walked right in and upstairs as the first floor of Boudin's was a little chilly. Were seating quickly and right by the window with a view of the bay. Service was fast. Had garlic cheese toast which was really good. Shared...a pizza (sausage and mushrooms). The food was warm and really tasty. Would visit again and try more things!More"}
{"review":"We came with high expectations, we were made to wait 30mins for our table even though we had a reservation.\n\nThe service was non existent, although I left a 20% tip and told the Walter as I left I did so even though he didn\u2019t...deserve it, his answer was \u201cwhatever\u201d and walked away.\n\nThe food was average at best.\n\nIt was deafeningly noisy.\n\nAvoid this place...More"}
{"review":"Visited March 2019. Four stars because our server was clearly disappointed that we were there. We arrived at 2 or 3pm for a late lunch. The cocktails, food, and coffee were great. This was my last restaurant meal before returning home to Dallas. I plan...to return at a peak hour with a reservation.More"}
{"review":"Super service, excellent food, amazing setting but very expensive... but hey, you are in San Francisco!"}
{"review":"Absolutely delicious meal! We didn't know what to expect before coming, we had only been recommended the place by a friend, so the \u00e0 la carte dining style caught us by surprise. It is a bit on the expensive side, but it shows in the...quality of the food and the service so it was worth it in the end. I probably had the best squid I've ever had and the dumplings were phenomenal. It was a bit difficult for my vegan friend to find an actual meal, but she ended up ordering the vegetarian spring rolls and the mung bean dumplings which suited her fine. You're also treated to a beautiful view of the Bay Bridge, especially at night!More"}
{"review":"Lovely view of the Bay Bridge and and San Francisco Bay. Nathan was awesome. We had a couple of great soups and some spring rolls with drinks. Fabulous."}
{"review":"We are regular but infrequent visitors to San Francisco ( every 1-2 years) but for the past 5 years or so we have always visited Slanted Door at least twice per visit and been knocked out with the food, setting and service. In fact two...years ago on a US wide tour of fine eateries it was the best meal we found.\nSo, it was with great anticipation that we returned last night to introduce 3 colleagues to the delights.\nRegretfully, things seem to have changed. A few recent reviews hinted that it had started to rest on its laurels but we were unprepared for the degree of decline.\nWe were shown to our table by a very dour and graceless hostess and then greeted by a server who hopped from foot to foot like a toddler wanting the toilet whilst wearing a smirk right out of the Priti Patel collection. \nThe appetisers were as we remembered, fresh and very tasty although the second order of dumplings were a bit heavy on garlic. The wine was also great and fairly priced -Gruner Veltliner with our appetisers and Pinot Noir with our mains.  \nThe main courses were appalling. A whole black bass was charred and massively overcooked. Priti reacted badly to having his attention drawn to it and declared that a repeat order would be cooked just the same. So, my colleague ordered scallops ( as did I..) They were literally thrown in the table in front of him by a different server without a word. The scallops were large and well cooked but the accompanying sauce was incredibly acidic and unpleasant to the taste. I left most of mine. Priti had by this time vacated the premises, perhaps to give the many unfortunate homeless people in SF a good kicking....\nA pleasant young lady enquired about our meal and expressed her apologies after we had regaled her with our experience. She deducted the appetisers and one main from the bill. This was a welcome and proportionate response but could obviously not fully make up for the huge disappointment. \nIt will be interesting to see whether the Slanted Door will still be in business the next time we visit in 2022....More"}
{"review":"I have been coming here for business meals for many years but this is the first time I was able to take my wife.  We had a table next to the window so we had a good view of the Bay Bridge.  The spring rolls...did not have much taste, but the entrees, scallops and shaking beef were excellent.  The portions were adequate.  A little expensive, but this is SF and the entrees were good.  The service was very prompt, I'm sure so they can turn the tables over faster as the place was very busy.More"}
{"review":"A colleague recommended Slanted Door as a must visit while in SF. I dined at the bar which had attentive and entertaining service. The food was good - ordered the green papaya salad, filet mignon with red onions and truffled fried rice with mushrooms and...egg - though not as memorable as I would have hoped.More"}
{"review":"The entrance to the Slanted Door is in the Ferry Building. This venue can accommodate a range of needs. Many tables for two have a bay view; there is a large private room that would suit a working lunch; there are seats at the bar....Service is attentive yet unobtrusive, welcoming and instructive for first time guests, and professional. We ordered slanted door spring rolls, grilled lemongrass pork shoulder with noodles, greens, and sauce. Ingredients were carefully prepared and dishes well balanced in terms of texture, saltiness, sour, and spice. Our hazelnut dessert and cappuccinos left us very satisfied, with plans to return as soon as possible. Highly recommended!More"}
{"review":"A friend recommended this place over Valentines while my wife and I were visiting San Francisco.  They were totally booked for the whole weekend, so we were disappointed we couldnt try it, and didn't even look to see what kind of food it was.  After...a 10 hour wine tour we were exhausted Saturday night at 8:30 pm and were looking for a place to eat.  We found out it was near our hotel so my wife called to see if there was a chance we could get in.  The lady said the bar area was open and they served the full menu there.  We walked over, got there about 9:00 and were seated immediately.   They brought the menu and we saw it was Vietnamese food...I wasn't really sure if I would like it.  We ordered the crispy spring rolls, carmelized shrimp, and shrimp dumpling appetizer.  They brought the spring rolls that game with lettuce, mint and noodles...we didn't really know what to do, so a staff member walking by noticed and stopped to help.  You put them together like tacos, and they were EXCELLENT.  As was everything we ate!  The service and staff were awesome and they really made our night and our trip as we were not impressed with anything else we ate in SF.    I highly recommend this restaurant.    Thanks for a great night...More"}
{"review":"Service was excellent and matched the food.  We definitely will be returning.  The lemonade was made fresh and tasty, along with the hot milk tea which I ordered...Definitely enough food for a satisfying meal.  Located in the Ferry Building with a view of the Bay...very...busy, moderately noisy for dining.More"}
{"review":"He likes this place.  We loved the Vietnamese food and the simple explanations of how to eat some of the items.  My wife usually wants vegetarian and was very happy. The crowd all seemed pretty happy.  The view is pretty wonderful too."}
{"review":"The restaurant has an attractive modern interior decor. It offers excellent views of the bay. The service was friendly and excellent. \n\nThe lemongrass pork was delicious. The ingredients were fresh and perfectly cooked. The pork had a great seared glaze. The flavors were excellent and...balanced. The plate had a generous amount of mint and the side of Thai chilies flavored in fish sauce brought wonderful spikes. \n\nThe black tea with condensed milk was new to me and perfect.More"}
{"review":"Decided to come back here after having a great memorable experience back in 2017. This time was different. The food was just ok... The view was incredible but that won't ever change. The staff was snappy and rushed. Not the same feel as before. It...was expensive and to be honest super salty. We were drinking water at 3 am from salt overload. I hope it gets better because it is a staple in SF. We will try again one day.. maybe we just felt this way because it was on off day for them.... Hoping it's not the trend.More"}
{"review":"I booked Slanted Door through American Express at their recommendation.  It included, dessert and it was written on the reservation that I was vegan. We came into the restaurant and was greeted by a cold unfriendly member of staff who made us feel like we...shouldn't be there.\nWe were taken to a small table near the window, lovely view for one, the other person had their back to this wonderful view of the water and bridge. We were given menus with no comment made to the fact that I was vegan.  I wouldn't have expected any comment in a basic restaurant but Slanted Door was expensive and smart.\nWe were told the menu was meant for sharing which really wasn't much good considering we had one meat eater and one vegan but we ordered two vegetable dishes, a rice and tuna. The food was at best warm but I'd say nearer to cold. it was also tasteless.  I did tell the waitress who changed one dish for some carrots, also really not very exciting.\nThey brought the dessert menu and mentioned that we had one complimentary dessert only, how absurd, what good is one dessert of there is more than one person on the booking.\n$176.00 for one course a bottle of wine and one dessert, including an 18% minimum tip and I begrudged every cent, they really didn't deserve anything, felt like they were doing us a favour for the whole meal.\nIf this is the best San Francisco has to offer, I'd recommend McDonalds instead.More"}
{"review":"Don Pistos was the first restaurant we ate at on our first day in San Francisco and it set our standards high for the rest of the week! The chips and salsa starters were delicious and were given two free refills by the staff, who...were all very friendly. The taquitos were delicious (and gluten free), but came with a sauce that we were not keen on at all, so stuck with the salsa! Would eat here again :)More"}
{"review":"Had an amazing dinner- sat outside, busy with take out but service was excellent, great tacos and margarita"}
{"review":"We chose Don Pisto\u2019s because of its positive reviews on TripAdvisor, but we had some trepidations because it\u2019s a Mexican restaurant in Italian North Beach.  But we were more than pleasantly surprised.  Our reservation was promptly met, and the service was wonderful from the moment...we sat down.  Everything we had was delicious, especially the guacamole and margaritas.  The tacos, although small (as described), were both packed with ingredients and perfectly seasoned.  The best part of the meal was the Pisto\u2019a salad, a huge serving of corn, black beans, some lettuce and tomatoes in a yummy avocado vinaigrette.  Definitely worth the effort to find.More"}

{"review":"Nice Mexican restaurant . Had a great pitcher of strawberry margarita. Started with the ceviche of mahi that was to acidic with too much cilantro that made the dish a bit bitter. The main courses however were great . Really nice spicy shrimp tacos :...great taco Al pastor ; very friendly staffMore"}
{"review":"The food at Don Pisto\u2019s was quite nice. The al pastor tacos were really good, although the batter on the baja fish tacos was not that crispy and they tasted quite oily. We had the queso fundido and fried chicken as starters. The queso fundido...was good and was a big portion, but the tortillas it came with were really greasy. The fried chicken had a delicious crispy coating, but the habanero dipping sauce was way too spicy and made it unpleasant. The service was really lacking, which was the biggest disappointment. They didn\u2019t clear our starter plates when they brought our tacos so we didn\u2019t have much room on the table. Once we\u2019d finished our meal no one came over to clear the table or check on us, and there were only 2 other tables with customers in the restaurant. Overall it was a really average experience.More"}
{"review":"Lovely Mexican with a bustling atmosphere and delicious food. Overall a great restaurant, will definitely come back."}
{"review":"Our original choice was down the street from here but had an hour wait time. We lucked out when a reservation for two did not show up for Don Pisto\u2019s. The service from every worker in the building was amazing and our server was amazing...in her own right. We got the clams with chorizo for a starter and it was out of this world - the crusty toasted French bread was to fight for but luckily our server grabbed extra for us(and we don\u2019t eat bread). We split the 2lb lobster special and were not disappointed. Make a reservation and you will not be disappointed!!More"}
{"review":"Great food! Great customer service!!(summer was our server) and great ambience for Monday night! We had carne asada tacos & Mexican fried chicken and both were really good!!! We also tried hibiscus margarita which was really yummy!"}
{"review":"We loved Don Pisto\u2019s. It is a little hard to find as there is no name in the door, just an address. But it is worth the search. \n\nWe left our name and they texted us 40 minutes later with a table on a Saturday...night. While waiting we walked down the street to a wine bar where the server played tower of wine glasses for us. A very entertaining wait place. \n\nTheir chips and salsa are really good. The street corn appetizer was simply fabulous. 3 of the 4 of us had the chicken dish special...it was a huge portion of chicken, peppers, onions.  Very flavorful. \n\nWith 2 pitchers of margaritas our bill was $198. While that seems like a lot, we were very satisfied with the performance\/price ratio. \n\nAnd our service was excellent also!More"}

{"review":"Picked the end of December for a drive down from Sacramento to Los Angeles along the west coast, on the beautiful, incomparable US Coastal Highway 1.   This was along anticipated, 36-year dream plan to experience that coastline up close\u2026  Of course, the weather and our...airline (Southwest) both conspired to screw things up royally !!  It rained every day of our 10-day vacation except the last, and when we were to fly from Seattle to Sacramento, the airline industry had a meltdown, leaving us stranded at SeaTac at 5:30 in the morning.  Well, we couldn\u2019t give up, and rented a car and drove 17 hours through pelting rain to get to CA and assume our planned itinerary.  Wouldn\u2019t advise anyone to try this !!\n\nSan Francisco !  Another stop-over, while rushing pell-mell down the rainy coast, and we made it in time for our dinner reservation after checking in for a little rest and refreshment at the Union Square Hilton a couple of miles away.\n\nForeign Cinema is located in the historic Mission District, one of SF\u2019s original theater & cultural districts, and has been a landmark since 1999, earning multiple accolades.  Lots of stories and ancient legends hang around this neighborhood.  It\u2019s crowded by day, but the incessant rain kept everyone in hiding.  We had to walk a couple of blocks from where we parked, there was scarcely a soul, living or otherworldly, in sight.  \n\nIn the rain and semi darkness, it was almost hard to find the entrance.  It looks like an average, unassuming two-story store, and indoors, the magic begins.  The space is split up into several large and informal areas, sized for small or large groups and private dining rooms, reminiscent of the past, but very much alive and vibrant...   Part of the space is shared by Modernism West, an art gallery.. There\u2019s usually a movie playing on the double-height walls of the central space or the other rooms... classics with the golden moguls of Hollywood & Europe, from the golden age of the silver screen.\n\nThe atmosphere and cuisine are \u201ccountry urban rustic\u201d with a \u201cgenerosity of flavor and experience\u201d as described by the owners\u2026 it comes together with the local environment and the living community, and has survived the pandemic while shutting down completely, but taking care of their employees through that terrible time ~ as \u201cthe world went to zero.\u201d\n\nWe started with a carafe of 2020 Gamay Wild Soul Beaujolais ($40), with a serving of Cara Cara & Dates ($18) accompanied by the Bread Service and a Butterscotch Pot de Cr\u00e8me ($17.50 together) and enjoyed the fresh, chewy and crispy breads with the fruit and creamy butterscotch instead of the usual butter that most places offer.  This was \u201cdifferent\u201d, as promised, and it was good to relax and let the Gamay take its course, relaxing us after the day\u2019s rainy drive from Gualala.\n\nFor mains, we had the Five spice duck breast ($35) and Grilled Akaushi Wagyu bavette steak ($40).  Both are not to be missed if you go to this fine establishment.  The duck is redolent with roasted cherries and the blackcurrant juice, and the steak is sublime with the fingerling potatoes, Spanish onion and dripping with jus and salsa.  Just amaaaazing !  The room we were in did not have a movie playing, but there was one in the adjacent hall and could be glimpsed and heard.  One doesn\u2019t really have to watch the movie like in a theater, but it\u2019s there for the atmosphere and effect, while lingering over the incredible flavors and chatter from the other patrons around you.  Go for it, if you\u2019re in the District \u2013 definitely.\n\nOverall\u2026 at $175 plus tip for the two of us?  Well worth the stop and walk in the rain.More"}

Definitely recommend for special occasions.More"}
{"review":"Romantic New American restaurant that projects movies in the outdoor seating area. Reservations can be made online and I would highly recommend making it. It\u2019s located through the gray doors with a bunch of circles. There\u2019s a restrooms available in the hallway right outside of...the host stand. Indoor and heated outdoor seating is available. It\u2019s good for big groups as well as intimate dinners. I came here to celebrate my friend\u2019s birthday and it was a good am since for it. \n\nWe got two orders of bread (one of the Acme, and one of the schoolyard bread). Both were delicious and came with fresh butter on the side. The oysters were light and they had many varieties. The gem salad was well-dressed and quite light. For our entrees, we had the wagyu steak and the curry sesame fried chicken. I really liked the fried chicken, as the breading was light but still crispy, and the biscuit and honey butter that came in the side was super tasty. For dessert, we had the chocolate pot du creme and they added a candle and a little happy birthday for my friend. The chocolate was decadent and silky smooth. Overall, a good spot to eat in a nice ambiance.More"}
{"review":"Went for a birthday dinner recently with wife.\n\nMonday night 7pm dinner - thankfully had reservations. Wait times otherwise were about an hour.\n\nAmbiance was as expected. We were seated indoors, but close to the outdoor patio area which shows movies. The movies are of...course a background thing, doubt anyone's watching much of it. The vibe is of course movies - lots of posters and art pieces around.\n\nThe food is very good indeed. \nStarted off with a martini-grape juice cocktail. Very refreshing. \nThen a plate of Crab brandade as appetizer. Decent size for us.\n\nFor mains, we had the 5-spice duck breast - excellent choice. And the Grilled Akaushi Wagyu bavette steak - also excellent though second fiddle to the duck.\n\nFinished off with their special 'birthday' cake. A bit underwhelming compared to the other food.\n\nPrice was high as expected, but not extravagant.\nVery good service.\n\nRecommendedMore"}
{"review":"Foreign Cinema is a well-known place, with a well-deserved reputation as a local standout.\n\nThrow in the party piece of showing movies on the outdoor patio, and it\u2019s be easy for a place like this to coast. To rest on its laurels. To fall back...on a safe menu for tourists\u2026 encourage servers to turn those tables\u2026 to become one of Those Places that visitors flock to but locals avoid.\n\nHappily, none of that applies here. My experience with Foreign Cinema made it obvious that they work hard to create a superlative experience that delivers on the promise of the beautiful, sophisticated-but-casual surroundings.\n\nThe dishes my companion and I had were all hits, no misses. Wine options were solid: a nice, considered variety that fit well with the menu offerings. Better than it had to be, if that\u2019s the phrase you were hoping to read here.\n\nService was attentive and warm without hovering (or disappearing), and our waiter happily suggested some terrific favorites for us.\n\nIt\u2019s not a \u201cyou\u2019re here for the night; get comfortable\u201d kind of place, but I do recommend ordering a few things, then ordering a few more later\u2026 lingering just a bit, enjoying the movie, taking in the scene (because at some point in the evening it does become a lively, buzzing scene).\n\nHighly recommended.More"}
{"review":"My sister-in-law treated us to dinner here for our August birthdays. Excellent service. Our server attended to every detail including my husband's request for an extra 2 olives with the martini. The food was excellent for the salad, oysters, mahi mahi, tuna sashimi, and duck....The only disappointment was the Moroccan vegetable tagine. The flavor was seriously lacking in seasoning. In all fairness, we had just returned from Morocco and had high expectations. Our table was on the outside patio and there were heaters to keep the temperatures comfortable.  We were celebrating birthdays and the slice of birthday cake was AMAZING!! I would definitely return to this restaurant.More"}
{"review":"We had a wonderful experience at Foreign Cinema - we were able to get a late reservation (9:00 PM).  When we arrived the restaurant was still quite busy.  We sat in the outdoor area, the heaters were on and we were very comfortable.  The cocktails...were well made, with an interesting variety of ingredients.  Our meals were excellent, full of interesting flavors and textures.  I now recommend this restaurant to anyone traveling to SF.More"}

{"review":"Spectacular food in an amazing setting. San Francisco at its best! Tonight I enjoyed an unplanned dinner at Foreign Cinema. I didn\u2019t have a reservation, so I sat at the bar and had a phenomenal experience. Colleen expertly guided me through the menu options. I...landed on a selection of a half dozen oysters to start. That was followed by Monterey Bay calamari with a Oaxaca mole, sea scallops, chickpeas, aioli, totopos, lime, and cilantro. It was amazing! The main course (see photo) was Hawaiian mahi-mahi with cara cara orange, Meyer lemon salsa, asparagus, snap peas, celery root pur\u00e9e, and wispy chips. Again, incredible! Don\u2019t miss this great spot in the Mission. Book in advance to sit outdoors. The courtyard gives you the best of California weather while enjoy the best of its food.More"}
{"review":"I read an article on Foreign Cinema recently, so when my husband and I planned a trip to San Francisco, we had to add it to our list!

{"review":"Wife and I went for an early dinner before a show.  We were actually there for opening of the restaurant (5pm on a Saturday).  We checked in (just a heads up but we were required to provide proof of vaccination, which appears to be common...in SF and we were prepared for this) and were immediately seated.  My wife was complimented by the staff on her appearance and was presented with a black napkin to match her black dress.  This is something we were unfamiliar with and had to google, but apparently it is so white lint won't come off of a white napkin and show up on a dress.\n\nWe had seats inside which has a very nice feel with a fireplace going.  We were concerned about sitting outside because of it being winter but in hindsight, the heat lamps outside keep the area pretty warm.  Outside is where they play films during dinner.  The movie Gentlemen Prefer Blondes was playing the evening we were there.\n\nFor our order, we started with the fresh pulled mozzarella with persimmon and an arugula salad.  We also each had a cocktail.  I had the peppercorn duck breast and she had the pork chop.  Both tasted amazing.  We chose to not have dessert just because we were short on time for the show but overall I felt like the price was reasonable for the quality of food and experience.More"}

Lots of choice on the menu. \nCalamari plentiful and tasty. \nNice wine options. \nWill be returning again before we leave.More"}
{"review":"We rolled up around 6:45pm on a Tuesday night. Seating inside was tight, so we sat outside in the patio. Given it was chilly, they turned on the outdoor heater for our table. We were quickly waited on by a server, who gave us food...recommendations. Drinks and food came out rather fast for a group of 6, so that was great. I opted for the fresh squeezed lemonade and the Chicken Parmesan. My drink was very good. The entree was rather large but sufficient for someone who came hungry. The Chicken Parm wasn\u2019t anything special, but it wasn\u2019t bad. As such, I\u2019m opting for 3 stars. Would I return? No, as there\u2019s other great Italian eateries in north Beach.More"}

Two friendly older Italian men ran and served at the place. Indoor and extensive outdoor seating on a busy neighborhood street across from...the Washington Square park and St. Peter and Paul's Church popular with locals. Handmade pasta, fresh baked bread, wine, and much more. Popular with locals and Italian families, and seemed to be good for people out on dates. Food and atmosphere so good that we came back two more times over the next week at my daughters' insistence. This NEVER happens with my family. Beautiful place.More"}
{"review":"Enjoyed it. We visited with my sister and brother in law. We shared two pizzas and my wife and I shared a salad. A bottle of Hess Cabernet. Great dinner. We sat outside under a heater. Food and service were good just a great evening."}
{"review":"My boyfriend and I ate here one evening after touring the city. We walked up to view the menu, and then when we said we wanted to stay, no one seated us. There were 2 gentlemen serving that evening, and the younger of the two...somehow seemed to wish we weren't there, barely acknowledging us the entire time, until we were getting ready to leave. The older gentleman finally sat us and eventually gave us water, which we had to refill ourselves. The bread tasted stale. It was about 15 minutes until he took our order. I had spinach ravioli and my boyfriend had a salad and the roasted chicken. The other patrons outside and several inside seemed to be locals, or at least well known to the staff. They were very chatty and attentive with them, but we were largely ignored. When the food did come, it was delicious. Not sure what was happening here, but it was weird.More"}
{"review":"All around fantastic. Fried calamari and fried shrimp appetizer was outstanding. I loved the horseradish sauce.\n\nMargherita pizza was perfect. It was more of an American style pizza with an even layer of tomato sauce and cheese all the way across. It  was cooked to...perfection. The crust had a crispy cornmeal base, and it was perfectly crispy all the way across. Absolutely no soggy center.  I recommend allowing this pizza to cool a little bit before digging in. The first bites weren't quite as flavorful because the pizza was so hot. But once it cooled just a little, the amazing flavor and texture was much easier to enjoy.\n\nService was fantastic. Diet Pepsi glass was always full. \n\nI dined out on the sidewalk at one of the wooden tables. There are overhead heaters if you prefer, but I just enjoyed wearing a hoodie without overhead heat.More"}

In fact, it was sopping wet from sitting in the water for goodness knows how long. So when you cut into it, water just squired out all over my compostable paper plate. \nThe mashed taters and gravy were good, but again, just \"warm\", not hot.\nDon't even get me started on the \"baked beans\", seriously, what a joke.\nMore like Van Camps Pork and Beans. \nAppreciated the \"cold roll\" to soak up the gravy, but again, ice cold.\nTourists, stay away, it's not what it used to be, IMP!More"}

{"review":"The entrees (meats) were excellent, and obviously that's the real reason you're going here.  The sides were okay; pretty average diner-style sides.  The dinner rolls were literally not edible, but I'm sure they would make a good doorstop.  Prices were excellent for how much food...you get.  The restaurant itself is a little dark, and it is a CASH ONLY business, which would be fine, if the ATM inside actually worked.More"}

Inner city with rustic interior and at times patrons, but I always feel comfortable. Probably fine but not really sure this...is a place I would say \"bring my kids\" though. Very generous portions for the money of carved meat served deli style. I had the beef stew and it was delicious. Downed it with a cold draft. Nothing fancy but genuinely authentic.

We were lucky and there were some open window tables, and we were on a girls trip so willing to pay the premium for the 'experience'.  The service was solid, drinks were decent and the views were outstanding.  Try and go before sunset.More"}

As with all places like this, you do get people who have no issue standing right next to your seat with a view to see the view themself and take pictures. One cannot be upset with...this as it's like that at any cocktail lounge with a view. The drinks were a tad pricey, but again it's like that at comparable venues and it is a hotel too. I probably would not go here again, but it was something to try. The wait staff was great. I was all by myself and they checked on me multiple times and never felt rushed.More"}

{"review":"Visited the view lounge SF from the UK on the 10th of May. As soon as we got there we were told to find a seat and someone would be with us. After 30 minutes of waiting we finally got served. The waitress was insistent...that a card needed to be put down prior to ordering any food to \u201copen a tab\u201d. We\u2019ve never heard of this but as she was so insistent and told us that it was just to \u201chold our money\u201d until the final bill was sorted as we wanted to pay in cash. The waitress took my card and straight away I had a notification that the whole amount in my bank account was taken out. When she came back we told her that my money had been taken, she again was adamant that it would go back onto my card as soon as we closed our bill in cash. So we ordered food to share and a drink each, asked for the bill and paid in cash and leaving a really generous tip considering. We got in the lift and then I realised that I still hadn\u2019t been refunded my money. We spent 30 minutes going up and down in the lift trying to get back to the rooftop bar but as it was after 10:30pm they don\u2019t allow the lifts back up. We went to reception who then said that the waitress gave us the wrong information and that the refund would take time to go back onto my card. We tried explaining that they\u2019d actually taken ALL of my money that was in my account for my holiday. Again the receptionist was NO help and said these things take time (like all banks and cards etc) and we should have the refund 5-7 working days. It\u2019s been nearly 2 weeks since our visit to the view lounge in SF \/- I\u2019ve currently returned to the UK still with NO refund! I\u2019ve contacted both the view lounge via social media and the Marriott hotel who have also read my messages but NOT had the professionalism to reply to me! I\u2019ve now opened a case with my bank as this is daylight robbery making you hand over your card and NOT giving a refund even though you pay in cash. I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND GOING HERE AS THE HASSLE ISNT WORTH IT UNLESS YOU HAVE MONEY TO WASTE ON THIN-AIR!More"}
{"review":"Impressive lounge at top of Marriott Marquis.   Has 2 distinct seating areas that have different views of the city as well as sprawling bar to mix and mingle.   There were very few patrons on Wednesday an  hour before sunset allowing us to select any cocktail...table next to the gigantic 3 story window.  Impressive to see on a clear evening as lights turn on in city.  \n\nWe ordered \"fog city\" and  old fashion(apparently know for)  for appetizer we shared short ribs.  We agreed the drinks did not match the ambiance simply nothing that wanted us to order another. Short ribs were very skimpy and  not shareable.

{"review":"Just a Great Breakfast\n\nIn February, we were back in San Francisco for a wine maker event, and though we were staying at another hotel, near Union Square, walked over to the Taj Campton Place, to have breakfast at their restaurant, Campton Place, just off...of their lovely lobby.\n\nThe room was lovely, even on a gloomy morning, and we were seated in one of the booths, across from the windows.\n\nWith coffee on the table, my wife went with the California Breakfast w\/ two eggs, home fries, a breakfast salad, wheat toast, applewood-smoked bacon and cranberry juice. This was, as always, an excellent choice. The \u201cover-easy\u201d eggs were perfectly cooked, and I inherited most of her home fries, as she is just not a potato person at breakfast.\n\nI opted for the Lobster Knuckle Frittata w\/ breakfast salad. I have had this dish before, and only once was not 100% pleased. This morning, it was great!\n\nService was excellent, and our coffee cups always refilled.\n\nWhile not inexpensive for breakfast, we both feel that for the quality of the food, this is one of the best breakfast values in the Union Square area. We always have breakfast here, when staying at the Taj Campton, but then walk over, when we are not.More"}
{"review":"Only Breakfast, Lunch and Drinks on This Visit\n\nIn October, we were back at the Taj Campton Hotel, and dined in their Michelin-starred Campton Place restaurant, and its attached bistro. While we have had several dinners at Campton Place, we dined off-property each evening of...this trip.\n\nThe breakfasts were both great, and I often dine here, when not staying at the hotel - it is good enough to walk from beyond Union Square, or the SoMa Area, and is probably my favorite breakfast in San Francisco.\n\nFirst, Campton Place is really three venues in one: an intimate bistro, and then a small bar with seating at one end, and finally a lovely Michelin-starred restaurant, open for breakfast, and then dinner.\n\nOn this trip, I did two breakfasts in the restaurant, and one lunch, plus wines, at the bar, in the bistro.\n\nFor the breakfasts, in the elegant dining room, Chef Srijith Gopinathan\u2019s creations and adaptions came through. Even with some traditional breakfast items, Chef Gopinathan\u2019s hand is evident.\n\nI only got to have breakfast one morning with my wife, as she had a breakfast meeting the rest of the stay.\n\nI then had on lunch in the bistro, and got to play around with several of their new wines, on their small, but interesting B-T-G list.\n\nA couple of very nice meals, and fun wines, with excellent service.More"}

{"review":"We had previously dined at the Michelin-starred Campton Place restaurant, in the Taj Campton Place Hotel, many times. Since the inception of Chef Srijith Gopinathan\u2019s Spice Route Tasting Menus, we had been great fans. Fairly recently, in July, that Tasting Menu seemed to have become...a second thought, though on our previous visit, it seemed that the spark had come back, and we had a fabulous meal, reminiscent of much earlier experiences.\n\nOn this visit, the room was as lovely, as always, but several things just seemed off: the Spice Route menu was again lacking focus, and also execution, the wine pairings were basically just the By-the-Glass selections, and with but one exception, did not compliment the dishes this time. The service was also a bit off, as well.\n\nNow, Campton Place had just lost one of its two Michelin stars, but instead of working hard to win that back, they seemed to just be phoning it all in. On this visit, it seemed that the excitement had drained from the menu. Dishes were OK, but all lacked any spirit, and the textures were all wrong - just too amorphous to work. The same could be said for the colors: mostly browns and greys.\n\nNothing was badly missing, but nothing was stellar, as we had come to expect. One missing aspect however, was the purse stool, provided to the ladies in the dining room, which was always a nice, and welcomed touch. Oh wait, they still had those, but did not see fit to provide one for my wife?\n\nOur July Spice Route Menu was:\n\nTruffle Naan w\/ caramelized butter, and 5 grams of Australian black truffle at $40 supplemental charge - This was a very good starter.\n\nSpice Pot w\/ \u201cChaas,\u201d tamarind chutney and cilantro - Still a cute idea, but this version lacked the \u201csoul\u201d of many previous versions.\n\nPoached Lobster w\/ Spring peas, wood sorrel, cipollini and coastal curry - While we both love lobster, this dish did not do anything for either of us. The lobster was quite tough, with little flavor, even with the curry.\n\nDay Boat Scallop w\/ dosa, turmeric, mustard and kale thovial and for my wife, with a bi-valve allergy, Heirloom Kale w\/ kale composition, fresh edamame, shallots and black mustard - Neither dish was at all exciting, and the kale was actually more flavorful, than the scallop.\n\nAlaskan Halibut w\/ spiced lentil dust, snow peas, baby leeks and Spring herb broth - The fish was so-so, and both dishes found it overcooked.\n\nGuinea Hen w\/ Summer herb saag, chanterelle, purslane and spiced tomato vinaigrette - Better, but still lackluster.\n\nHoli Cow w\/ cow\u2019s milk variations with almonds, mango and saffron, for me, and Super Bloom w\u2019 rhubarb, lychee, yogurt and cardamom for my wife - Her\u2019s was the better, but then I am not really a \u201cdessert person,\u201d preferring a Cheese Course to most.\n\nThe Tasting Menu was $167 (plus $40 for the Truffle Supplement), and then Wine Pairing for $125.\n\nBesides the uninspired wine choices, the wine service was not up to the usual high level, but then there was a new sommelier at the helm, and maybe he was getting his bearings?\n\nIn all, a major disappointment, from one of our favorite restaurants in San Francisco, and maybe the Spice Route Tasting Menu has just run its course? I am not sure that we will be back for dinner, even when staying at the hotel - time will tell.\n\nDuring this stay, we did two breakfasts at Campton Place, and both were excellent, as per usual. We also spent time in the Bistro, with our own \u201cwine tastings.\u201d Those experiences elevated the entire dining experience over the Spice Route Menu w\/ Wine Pairings.More"}

{"review":"Ate here while a guest in the Taj Hotel. Tasting menu and wine pairing.\n\nAs I frequently visit India for work, I was quite excited to see this \"Indian take\" on Californian cuisine, overall I was left slightly disappointed.\n\nFood: All beautifully presented and portion...size was spot on. Flavors were hard to fault but I found the spice levels to be very subdued and maybe toned down extensively for a certain type of palate.\nSome dishes showed some Indian influences but on the whole if I wasn't told what the theme was I may have missed it.\n\nWine: All good quality and the pairings were good aside from one.\nThe first drink offered was white sherry which took me by surprise as I'd never seen it served outside of my grandmothers living room. It's not popular for a reason, please take it off your menu if you haven't already!\nThe other wines were good but didn't blow me away, the Zin from Lodi was a highlight.\n\nService: Waitress was knowledgeable but icily polite and stiff. I feel like she maybe took the meal a whole lot more seriously than I did, after a good few glasses of wine I approach few things seriously.\n\nSommelier was happy to answer my questions as each wine was delivered.\n\nMain kudos to the older Chinese gentleman who dropped off and collected the dishes. He had a great manner, massive smile and good sense of humor. He warmed up the occasion, promote him!\n\nTo sum up: Hard to fault the quality, disappointingly western, slightly stiff service. I would have just preferred a 5 star biryani with a few poppadoms.More"}
{"review":"Terrible service. Two out of 5 drinks to our table came after entrees were almost done. Main course pf Lobster was mediocre at best. Angus Steak was marvellous. Dessert for all five folks were B grade restaurant level. We passed our plates around for sampling....Prices were par with similar joints. Cooking has deteriorated substantially since our last visit. Not worthy of any M*.More"}
{"review":"We were greeted very warmly at the entrance by a very tall gentleman yet with a gentle and warm mannerism. We did expect a bit more of Indian flavoring with the entrees of five-course meal that we each had. The wine pairing was not excellent...but was fun to experience with each entree as recommended. We thought it was a bit humorous when there was a spill of very obvious stain on our white cloth table which was ignored by our waiter to servers. No one bothers to clean it up. The noise level was much higher than we had expected. We sat next to a table of 4 and their volume was so loud, we had a hard time hearing ourselves. \nOur overall experience was fun. We enjoyed the food and wine serving passage, but I think the waiters and servers can be more polished for Michelin stars restaurant. We have dined from 1 start to 4 stars Michelin restaurant, our rating would be more of 4 stars for the food and how well it was prepared, 3 stars for the overall services, and 2 stars for the noise volume (the restaurant may not have any control over certain guests), and lastly 5 stars for the quite exceptional main host at the entrance as we entered and exit. He was the star employee at this restaurant.More"}
{"review":"If you want to go super upscale (you know, two Michelin stars upscale) on your Indian, don't miss this amazing restaurant. Prix fix only, they have a 4-course menu and a 6 course.   Both wines by the glass, 1\/2bottle and bottle are wide-ranged and paired...well with the meal.  Vegetarian dishes as well as lamb, beef and seafood are available.  Black Cod (which was sustainably sourced!!) and lamb (cooked perfectly medium rare) were highlights of the menu.  The various off menu small bites had a wide-range of flavor profiles to expand your pallet a bit.  I'd save my money and some day come back for the 6 course extravaganza!More"}

We had a complementary tiramisu that was a little bit different and more creamy and not the unctuous coffee taste that we personally like.More"}

They have a nice outdoor dining area with good service and they are open all day which is really nice so this place has some good elements to it.  The problem...is the food is absolutely terrible or at least the pasta with the tomato sauce is.  Nobody who lives in the marina actually goes to this place because they know the food is bad.  It is too bad because they do a lot of things well here in terms of atmosphere, etc..More"}
{"review":"This restaurant offers fresh Italian cuisine in the Marina district. Service by Alessio was charming and he guided  us through the options in the menu.\n\nWe started with the Suppli - fried rice balls - which were very good. The carbonara, which I ordered due...to food envy from the night before, was okay but not as good. Another item we enjoyed was one of the specials of the day,  a risotto with seafood.\n\nFinished the night off with Nonna's lemon and almond cake which was delicious and was served with homemade fresh whipped cream. Yum!\n\nCharming service and good food - would definitely recommend and visit again.More"}

We searched for places nearby we could eat at & Roma Antica popped up &...we are so happy it did!  We had the Burrata Caprese (with prosciuto) ... fantastico!  Then we split the Carbonara ... I think the best I've had anywhere, including Roma IT.  The Carbonara was so rich we were stuffed so we didn't share a pizza as we had planned ... we'll do that when we return.  Service was outstanding as was the food.  Indoor & outdoor dining.  On top of all that, they have very reasonable prices, especially for San Francisco, including their wine list.More"}

{"review":"We walked from our hotel, the Intercontinental San Francisco, near Oxford and 5th, about 0.8 mile based on the listing in the idine program, but mostly flat and easy to walk.  We arrived just as a man was opening up and before our server, OTGOO,...by the receipt, arrived. We sat at a table just inside by the window near the end of the bar.  We were in no hurry so we told her to take her time.  Other half had coffee w cream and Corned Beef Hash Benedict w bowl of fresh fruit.  The corned beef hash was freshly made at restaurant and was texture of pulled pork.  He said it was some of the best corned beef hash ever!  I drank only water and had the California omelet, topped by sliced half avocado,  w dry Sourdough and Home Fried Potatoes.  The ingredients were all fresh and more than enough.  Service was top notch,  Price was fair, $33 in total, before tax and tip.  My only curiosity was that I left a higher tip than was processed on the credit card,  I had rounded up the total to an even dollar, but only an even dollar tip amount was posted???  The server could have had an additional 49 cents???  My 19% tip turned out to be only 18%.  If we hadn't had breakfast included in our remaining hotel nights at the Mark Hopkins, I would have hiked back here both mornings for breakfast even though it was 3 blocks straight up and down from Nob Hill and a good exercise.   In conclusion, I wish I could find a great breakfast like this here in Florida since I am a big breakfast person.  They serve breakfast all day, and I highly recommend!!!More"}

{"review":"Tadich Grill is a timeless tradition who has not loosen the reigns to high quality dining!    \n\nThe selection is vast and everything listed is a good option.  On this particular occassion, the Friday night special was the Lamb Shank and it proved to be as...special as advertised.  The meat was so tender that it slid off the bone and there proved to be no gamey residual, just delicious, flavorful and sizeable!  The ravioli with meat sauce was also quite tasteful with generous amounts of Meat in the meat sauce and YES, the ravioli is filled with meat as well!  The portions are incredibly large and the service is impeccable! The waitress gave some wonderful recommendations and checked on patrons quite often without being disruptive.   The most amazing attribute to this restaurant is that they do not rely on the novelty of being California's oldest restaurant to bring in customers but rather they keep their focus on the quality of food which is very high. However, the character of the restaurant is more than enough to keep patrons coming back for more.  A giant hardwood bar where customers can dine and drink is reminiscent of a time gone by.   \n\nTadich Grill is an excellent restaurant which deserves multiple visit!  Great food, large selection, fantastic service and a nostalgic setting.More"}
{"review":"I had dinner with friends at Tadich Grill, my first time there. It's really a San Francisco institution - the oldest restaurant in the city and a definite old-school throwback in terms of the atmosphere and menu. It's very close to several public transit options...so that's what I took to get there. My friends and I were seated at one of the semi-enclosed tables behind the large central bar. Our server was great and very attentive, even though it was a busy evening at the restaurant, and other staff were helpful as well. \n\nAlthough there are other items on the menu, Tadich Grill's specialty is seafood, and I ordered the mesquite charcoal broiled petrale sole filet, served with long branch potatoes plus broccoli, cauliflower, and carrots. The portion was larger than I'd expected, and the fist was prepared very simply and was delicious. The potatoes were also good, but the vegetables, although cooked just enough, were lukewarm at best - perhaps an issue with the busy night but still not what you'd hope for. There was a limited choice of wines by the glass on the main menu (I didn't ask whether there was a separate wine list) but the wine I ordered was fine and went well with the sole. \n\nTadich is a bit pricey, which was not unexpected, but seems like a good choice for a special night out, particularly if you're looking for a more traditional San Francisco meal. Not a place I'd return to often but I'd be happy to go back.More"}

{"review":"Once upon a time, in the city of San Francisco, a place renowned for its culinary diversity and vibrant dining scene, I embarked on an evening at the esteemed Tadich Grill. Brimming with anticipation, my party and I sauntered into the restaurant, eagerly awaiting a...culinary experience that had been lauded for its historical significance and gastronomic delights.\n\nAs we settled into our seats, the initial charm of the restaurant enveloped us. The vintage decor, aged wood, and murmur of lively conversation whisked us away to a time when hospitality was an art form, practiced with reverence and dedication.\nBut alas, dear reader, our fleeting sense of enchantment was soon shattered like a fragile champagne flute dropped on the cold, unforgiving kitchen floor.\nUpon perusing the menu, we discovered that not everyone in our group was inclined to indulge in a full-fledged dinner. Some among us, perhaps less ravenous or with dietary restrictions, sought only to sample the appetizers and drinks that Tadich Grill had to offer. A simple request, we thought, for any dining establishment that prided itself on being a beacon of hospitality.\n\nYet, as the evening unfurled, it became glaringly evident that the powers that be at Tadich Grill had forgotten the very essence of hospitality, choosing instead to wield their authority with a heavy hand and an iron will. Like a sommelier refusing to pour a glass of wine for a parched soul, the manager emerged from the shadows, casting his disapproving gaze upon us.\n\nWith a tone as frigid as the fog rolling in from the bay, he unceremoniously declared that we were not welcome to occupy our table unless all members of our party partook in the sacred ritual of ordering a full meal. The callousness of the proclamation left us stunned, our sense of disbelief matched only by the audacity of the decree itself.\n\nIn that moment, I yearned for the days of old when the sanctity of the dining table reigned supreme, and the customer was revered as royalty. A time when a ma\u00eetre d' would have charmed us with his suave demeanor, seating us with a flourish and a smile, regardless of our culinary inclinations. A time when the staff's aim was not merely to fill tables but to fill hearts with joy and delight.\n\nI pondered how Tadich Grill, a bastion of tradition, had strayed so far from the true essence of hospitality. A restaurant that had witnessed generations of diners, breaking bread and forging memories, now chose to cast aside potential patrons merely because their desires did not align with a rigid, outdated model.\nGood service, my dear reader, transcends the perfunctory act of placing plates before patrons and whisking them away when empty. It resides in the warmth of a welcoming smile, the attentiveness to individual needs, and the genuine desire to make every guest feel special, regardless of their appetite.\n\nAlas, Tadich Grill's misguided stance left a bitter taste in my mouth, not from the fare they served, but from the disheartening realization that they had lost sight of what it truly meant to treat customers with the respect and consideration they deserved.\nAs I departed from that storied establishment, I couldn't help but wonder if the ghosts of bygone culinary legends wept at the state of hospitality in the present day. May this lament serve as a reminder to all who enter the realm of gastronomy - it is not just the food that leaves a lasting impression, but the graciousness and hospitality bestowed upon every soul that crosses the threshold.More"}

{"review":"My first visit here, since 2005, on Tuesday evening. I remember the Tadich being famous for its sand dabs. 17 of us, a post work event. On one table. Four of us arrived on time and asked to go to our table. The blunt, arrogant,...bordering on rude, staff said we were \u2018not allowed\u2019 to be seated until our entire party had arrived. We were told to wait at the bar, in a space barely big enough for two people. We were already blocking the aisle. When I asked how up to 16 of us would fit into the same space, I was told, \u2018that\u2019s our policy\u2019. At the table, the slightly arrogant behaviour was maintained, the service was slow, the food was mediocre and cold. The biggest disappointment was, no sand dabs. They were off and \u2018might never be on again\u2019. Last night, I dined solo. Warm welcome, asked to pick any spot at the bar. My waiter, tall, grey haired gentleman, was friendly and professional. I ordered clams followed by the calamari steak both were excellent. I also had a couple of pints of anchor steam. Completely different experience. No idea why. My advice, I guess, is give this wonderful restaurant a try, but not in a large group.More"}
{"review":"All of the food we tried was disappointing. San Francisco has much better restaurants for clam chowder and cioppino. The lamb chops needed seasoning.

{"review":"This place was the opposite of EPIC. Terrible service, rude servers, mediocre food\u2026\n- The didn\u2019t seat us where we had noted in our reservation, the front desk guy was very unprofessional and didn\u2019t even apologize. He could barely speak English\n- the server kept...pushing us to order wine or cocktails, we kept saying we don\u2019t want any and he acted so surprised and disappointed, we couldn\u2019t believe his attitude, at this point we knew something was wrong with this place\n- Then he brought water. Adding to our dismay, the water glasses had an unpleasant odor. When we politely requested replacements, the server responded angrily, insisting there were no alternative water options and denying any odor.\n- The quality of the food was subpar at best. I orderer a medium well steak but what arrived was a rare one! I showed this to their manager and she agreed this is not mid well. Then they just took the remaining meat on my plate and reheated it instead of bringing a new plate. Is this too much to ask for a $70 meal??\nAt the end we complained to the manager and she tried to make up for all this  dissatisfaction with a desert. While we appreciate the gesture it didn\u2019t make up for the ruined night and money. We won\u2019t be coming back.More"}

He was knowledgeable about the wine and menu, had a great personality and was a joy.  All six of us ordered the filets and each was cooked to perfection and serve exactly as ordered. The sides were very tasty and all servings were hot.  The deserts were amazing.  We also thought the prices were fair for the quality of the food. We would definitely recommend dining at Epic.

{"review":"We had a fun night, Thursday evening, January 12th, enjoying friends, the ambiance of the restaurant, view of the Bay Bridge after finishing at JP Morgan week in San Francisco, and having arrived on Saturday, so we were looking to relax, wind down, and enjoy...a stellar meal! This was our first time here for all of us, and we split the Caesar salad, 28-day aged bone-in 32-ounce porterhouse steak medium rare, SF Brian Flannery New York sirloin medium rare, black truffle mac and cheese, Julia Child's potatoes with gruyere cheese, Brussel sprouts, and hen of wood mushrooms. The evening was Epic! The lovely two hostesses that greeted us made us feel welcome, and Adrian was our waiter and made suggestions on meal options along with the wine list. We thoroughly enjoyed our meal, and steaks were outstanding complimented by the side dishes, plus we have the most amazing view of the Bay Bridge! Thank you to all for a wonderful meal, at a place not to be missed! On a separate note: the lights on the Bay Bridge are funded through private donations, and if the $'s raised do not meet the budget, there is a plan to turn off the lights on the bridge. We have been to Water Bar and Slanted Door (closed on this trip) and always admired this view. Let's hope the lights stay on post March 2023!More"}
{"review":"I've been searching for a restaurant where I will\u00a0enjoy perfectly cooked meat and envibe app recommends Epic Steak. For meat lovers, you will find here almost everything you want. IMO\u00a0the best damn filet from their menu is something you should try as a meat lover\u00a0...\u00a0More"}
{"review":"Epic provides an excellent setting and very friendly and professional staff. \n\nIt isn\u2019t the cheapest - but the steak was succulent and very tasty, while the shrimp starter was excellent. \n\nWould I return - yes in a heartbeat. \n\nThere was a real cross in the...patrons attire - from dressed up, to jeans and very casual. \n\nNeither felt out of place\u2026 \n\nIt was an extremely enjoyable experience.More"}
{"review":"If you love steak, this is the place for you. I came here with my wife while we were on our honeymoon. The staff were great, our server Tregg was super nice and enthusiastic. He helped us pick steaks and gave recommendations on how to...have them cooked. The restaurant was busy but we always felt looked after. We had a great view looking out on to the Bay Bridge. The food was delicious, the steak was perfect and the sauces and seasonings complimented each other really well. We finished the night with a delicious cocktail. Overall great experience.More"}
{"review":"Beautiful waterfront location with a great view of the bay & the food does not disappoint either! Not the cheapest place in the world but I\u2019d say it\u2019s worth it for a special occasion if you are a steak lover. They also serve wonderful (if...a little rude looking) deserts\u2026More"}
{"review":"I booked this place a few weeks before we came. \nThis is a really nice restaurant, the staff were very friendly and helpful. \nWhen I arrived all the staff had signed a birthday card, which I thought was a nice touch. \nWe sat outside on...a nice warm October evening and there was also heaters on. \nMe and my girlfriend both got a steak and as it was Restaurant Week, you can add $30 to add a starter and a dessert.  \nFor start we had the Caesar salad and soup, I had the ribeye steak and my girlfriend had the fillet, dessert we had the apple crumble and the carrot cake, we had some beers a glass of wine and finished off with a glass of port and an Irish coffee. \nThe food was delicious, all nicely cooked and prepared. \nThe view in the restaurant is amazing. Sitting on my 50th birthday having a lovely meal overlooking the Bay Bridge. \nI\u2019m very pleased this is where I chose for my birthday meal. \nIt is expensive but it\u2019s not every day you\u2019re 50. \nThe food and drinks came to around $300. \nThis is definitely somewhere I would recommend.More"}
{"review":"This was a surprising find for us.  We were staying overnight in Emeryville and needed to find a dinner spot for the same evening.

It was packed on a Friday night but we found two...seats at the bar.  Although busy, the service was great and the food was outstanding! Fresh made pasta was the best! Wouldn't hesitate to return on our next trip!More"}
{"review":"My wife used to work in the neighborhood years ago and i recall having very good meals there.  So today we were in the area again and i suggested lets try it. Had a great time. Service could not be friendlier. Blues on the sound...system fit the space and mood. Wife had perfect hamburger and i had delicious rigatoni Bolognese.  Good beer selection.  Wines were more limited and expensive..$15 -18 fir a glass ouch, oh we live in the Bay Area in 2022.  Happy to return, soonerMore"}

{"review":"We were invited to dine here with a friend who lives in Emeryville. It was a delightful experience. The food is wonderful and the service is very attentive and the place is so incredibly comfortable. I have lived in the East Bay since 1966 and...wish I had heard of this place sooner. I cannot wait to introduce my friends to it.\nThank you for a marvelous evening. We arrived at 5:45 and left at 10:00.More"}
{"review":"We were in the neighborhood I used to work in... and needed an outdoor lunch option as we had kiddos in tow, so Townhouse popped into mind.  SUPER GLAD they've reopened and please with Covid protocols here.  It's been a few years, so it was...a bit of a gamble, but one we are thrilled we took.\n\nThis is an old historic building + large patio that looks like it seats almost as many as they can inside.  The indoor vibe is carefully curated old mixed in with white tablecloths and outside is much more casual.  Brunch menu isn't huge but spans pretty much anything you could want.  There are kid options available as well. \n\nI ordered the shrimp and grits and was very pleased.  These are exceptional grits, perfectly cooked shrimp, and great tomato based sauce.  Came with two toasts that were likewise tasty.  There were a few bits un unrendered bacon fat that I picked out (texture I'm not a fan of), but fabulous dish that I'd order again in a heartbeat.  Hubby and 10 year old ordered BLT + avocado and we delighted in teaching the kid the new acronym BLAT.  Beautifully prepared delicious and somewhat messy sandos came with exceptional fries.  The picky 8 year old loved his side of extra crispy bacon and fries.  \n\nService was wonderful, attentive but not overbearing.  The outdoor setting had sun and shade, umbrella options, and heat lamp options.  We chanced upon a beautiful fall day and thoroughly enjoyed the sun.  Kiddos rated this a \"10 out of 10\" and included in the mix of their absolute favorite spots (Trabocco in Alameda and Habit).  Thrilled to expand our options and already looking back to our next visit.More"}
{"review":"I just didn\u2019t like the food. The bread was the only good thing on the table. I ordered a seafood tomato bisque soup and it was terrible. They brought me a second bowl that looked better, but the tastes were the same."}
{"review":"Townhouse is our favorite restaurant in Emeryville. It is just a short bike ride away for us and it has never disappointed us. Unfortunately, it is closed now for COVID-19, but we look forward to its reopening.  In my opinion, they could easily reopen the...outdoor in the back, put out a few tables on the front deck, and on the large parking lot and start cooking again. \n\nWhen it was open, we always preferred the backyard, because the interior could get a bit noisy in some spots. They do have a nice ambiance though - interesting paintings on the walls, high ceiling, and a full bar. \n\nThe food there is excellent, and the cocktails have always been superb. \n\nThe front looks like a shack and many people may be deterred by the look, but the restaurant inside it is very pleasant.  I don't know why they keep it this way, it may be to preserve the original facade, it may be for some other reason, but now it has become the trademark of the Townhouse, so it is not likely they'd change it.More"}
{"review":"Very good restaurant and nice place where spend dinner. Food is very good and if you love garlic you must try the fries with garlic. Fantastic....... but again if you love garlic."}
{"review":"We came here for a birthday celebration and the location was most interesting.  Not in an area that would assume a fine dining establishment would be.  Even from the outside, you would not think this was a place you would get a fine meal.  You...would be wrong.\n\nThe interior is rustic\/unfinished and appointed well to create a unassuming atmosphere.\n\nThe menu is very diverse with everything from \n\nWe started with pot stickers and cocktails.. great.  The mains were the ribs (w\/fries and mac & cheese), braised short ribs, seafood risotto and the seafood special.  Everything was prepared perfectly.\n\nA shared brownie sundae topped it all off.  Well worth the visit!More"}

{"review":"Been here for birthday parties, family get-togethers and date-nights, and loved it every time. Different food each time but all good, and the disconnect between the grunge exterior and the hip and attractive interior is just pr art of the fun.\n\nYou may want to...walk further north on a side-street, however, 'cos parking is pretty thick on that part of Doyle...or come by Caltrain and walk up 59th from the station!More"}

{"review":"Food: This is arguably the best culinary adventure of my life so far and loved that it's served family-style for everyone to share. We ordered the following 8 dishes (below). All were extremely fresh and tasty but the burrata & scarlet runner beans were my...absolute favorite - the perfect combination of textures (crispy beans and melt-in-your-mouth burrata) with the marvelous layering of flavors (earthy beans, creamy cheese, topped with zesty pomelo). \n\ncaviar potato cloud 12. - almost like a potato-flavored bubbles around salty, briny sea bubbles\nriverdog farm pig head 16. fennel, shinko pear & chile fish sauce - tender, almost paper-thin sliced salty contrasted with pear \nburrata & scarlet runner beans 20. pomelo, avocado & lemongrass-guava (see above)\nzuckerman farm asparagus 17. carmelized onion & marcona almond - tender asparagus with delectable savory onions paired with crispy almond\ncoal roasted peas & crispy galangal tofu 16. rhubarb, cashew, rau ram & lime  \nlocal halibut crudo 22. cherry aguachile, fava beans & basil\ngrilled alaskan halibut 42. artichoke barigoule, alubla blanca beans & green garlic - perfectly cooked halibut\nfried \u2018whole\u2019 mcfarland springs trout 72. blue corn, mandarin, tomatillo & salsa macha - black-rice batter perfectly protected the trout allowing it to be cooked to perfection\n\nService was almost impeccable. The only downside was our party had asked for hot water and lemon, which the server agreed brought the hot water but forgot the lemon. We reminded her again but by the end of service she still didn't bring the lemon. Not a big deal, especially given we arrived towards the end of service (8:30p) but nevertheless was a slight hiccup in our otherwise flawless service experience.\n\nAmbience: The Progress offers an elevated but not stuffy dining experience. You walk into a small waiting reservation where you're greeted by the maitre d'. You can see a casual bar area, which is usually full. The main dining room features plenty of plants, which downplay the two-story ceilings making the experience feel incredibly comfortable and not ostentatious at all.\n\nNote: there isn't much of a waiting area. I'd recommend bringing a warm jacket if it's cold outside.\n\nValue: The total for our dinner came out to $293.30 (food, tax, and tip), which is $75\/person. While it is 'pricy' we felt the culinary adventure was definitely worth the price, especially for a special occasion.More"}
{"review":"We loved every aspect of The Progress.\n\nThe atmosphere was warm and inviting - clearly a high-end place - but without feeling the least bit stuffy.\n\nThe service was friendly and extremely professional.\n\nFood and drinks were both creative and perfectly executed.  The chefs creativity...came through in the layering of flavors in each dish.\n\nHighly recommended.More"}
{"review":"Though this is among the best and most adventurous meals I\u2019ve ever had, this is not a hoity-toity place. It\u2019s as down to earth as it gets. The Maitre d\u2019 had sparkling eyes and a killer smile and was friendly and helpful and not dressed...up at all. The waiters were kind and funny and personable. And the food was unique and delicious and nuanced and complex and \u2014 I have to say it again \u2014 DELICIOUS. Everything we tried was scrumptious and had many levels of flavor. If you like food adventures, this place is for you.More"}
{"review":"On this visit we were not able to get into State Bird, so we decided to try The Progress.\nThis was a nice change after dining at SB numerous times.\n\nI requested for the bartender to make a special cocktail using certain spirits--and the drink...he made was sublime.  Beautiful and lovely on the palate.  \nOnly suggestion--the cocktail ice in the glass was too big for the smaller glass, every time I took a sip--I spilled drink on my shirt.\nThe dishes were amazing in flavor and contrasting texture.  The shishito pepper was my least favorite--waxy, chewy and skin was not well blistered--perhaps a different combination of sauces?\nCrispy Tofu was amazing, the butter beans were taken to a higher meaning and quite incredible all small dishes were refreshing and delightful.\nThe interior design was well thought out and loads of natural light.\nService was right on par with a slight pretense.\n\nThank you!!More"}
{"review":"We absolutely loved this place. We went on recommendation of our waitress at Seven Hills. The food was amazing! We had the shisheito peppers, dumplings, hen, and halibut. The perfectly constructed flavors of each dish were so good. We had a bottle of wine, a...Spanish Grenache, also very good. Service was impeccable. We will be back someday.More"}
{"review":"Couple of things to be aware of Reservation area must, they book up quickly,I made mine about 2 weeks in advance. Parking is not the friendliest, so ride sharing will most likely be your best option. \n\nWe dined on a Tuesday and our reservations were...for 8:15 p.m., we were seated about 10 minutes from checking in.  The ambiance was lively, our waiter was very versed in the  menu.  He broke down the dishes so we got a full understanding of what the dish was, which made the dishes very enticing and easy to narrow down our choices. \n\nOur party consisted of 3 adults and we ordered:\n\nBeets Marinated in Yuzu ( a citrus delight, very refreshing)\nTempura Artichoke ( made with rice flour, airy, crispy no trace of oil)\nLocal Halibut Crudo ( cooked to perfection, flaky, very moist, full of flavor)\nGrilled Lamb ( a good portion to share, cooked to perfection, lots of flavor, accompanied with a surprising turnip 3 ways)\nCoconut Custard for dessert ( we normally skip dessert but decided to finish properly, it was a delicious surprise )\n\nWe were all very happy, happy with all the dishes. It was enough food to feel satisfied without feeling like we over indulged. The first 3 dishes and dessert were small and the 2 meats the perfect size for sharing. \n\nWould love to return and experience the duck when I return to the Bay Area, it looked amazing.More"}
{"review":"I wasn\u2019t sure what to expect when I checked out the menu online.  But, I knew we were in good hands as soon as we ordered a drink at the bar.  Just watching the bartender make our drinks with style and fresh ingredients, I knew...we were in good hands.  The weird ven diagram menu doesn\u2019t do the dishes justice.  Definitely let the servers describe the menu.  We loved every dish - potato cloud and caviar, grilled cabbage, fried asparagus and the duck was incredible.  Every dish was delicious, in season and unique.  The service was friendly and professional.  Only issue was the space was a little loud, so not the place for a quiet conversation.  We will definitely be back!More"}
{"review":"More casual than I expected but very good, try the duck and the squid ink pasta.  Nice cocktails though we brought our own wine."}
{"review":"Had to wait a bit, despite having a reservation.  Well worth the wait. The food was delicious, the cocktails fantastic."}
{"review":"This place is just wonderful - creative and innovative, with each dish coming out as a completely surprising explosion of flavor and textures. From the flatbread roti, to the rather superstar duck dishes, this place has it all. The service is beyond belief--even on a...crowded holiday evening, with our waiter helping us through the menu, suggesting how many dishes to order (family style), and other helpful advice. Could not hope for more exciting happy birthday!More"}
{"review":"The Progress is our son\u2019s favorite SF restaurant so they put it at the top of the list for our recent visit, and we loved it.  We loved the decor\/vibe and the shared plate approach, and our servers were excellent.  We really enjoyed the signature...duck, but our favorite dishes were the rabbit, radishes, and brussel sprouts.  And the milk punch was a great way to top off the meal.  Given the price, it\u2019s definitely a special occasion restaurant, but I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll be back!More"}
{"review":"Really an absolute pleasure to dine here.  Dishes are meant to be shared family style.  You could only dream your family ate so well!  Fresh and always seasonal with a gracious staff.  Definitely a great meal will be had here."}
{"review":"I was expecting much more since I think next door (State Bird Provisions) is so outstanding. This is not. It's OK but not great. The waiter did not help us choose at all and we ended up with too much food and too much repetition....This is the kind of place you need a lot of guidance because the dishes are unusual. So I cannot give it the best review. It is interesting food but not great food.More"}
{"review":"We didn\u2019t get to try the food. We had a reservation on a Sunday night at 7 pm. We got there at 7:02. Their grace period was 15 min. There was no one at the door. It took five minutes for someone to come. They...said they were going to ck on our table. The lady came back and said they didn\u2019t have a table for us. We complaint but no solution was offered. They sat us at a long shared table. We waited like 10 minutes for someone to take our order. We got tired and left. Apparently having a reservation for a. Table doesn\u2019t mean anything for Ozumo.More"}
{"review":"I had high expectations for our meal, considering the price point, location, and decor.  The sushi was mediocre.  The steak tartare was not good and overwhelmed with sauce.  The California roll was bizarre and I think the crab was mixed with mayonnaise.  It was a...$300 meal that did not taste like a $300 meal.More"}
{"review":"Had an amazing experience here with the family. All sashimi and sushi rolls were delicious! Very cool decor and the service was excellent!"}
{"review":"After spending a cold rainy day soaking wet sight-seeing in S.F., we decided not to venture out for dinner and gave our restaurant Ozumo a try. We were treated one of our best sushi dinner we have so far. We walked in and sat at...the bar at no time., The bar tender was friendly, attentive but not intrusive. We are not big eaters so we ordered several Saisho: Wagyu Tarutaru (Wagyu tartare), Dohyo (spicy tuna tartare), Hamachi (yellowtail) and Benitoro (salmon belly). They were absolutely fantastic. Will definitely visit again next time in S.F. Highly recommended.More"}
{"review":"Good spot for sushi just off the Embarcadero \nand near the Ferry Building. Nice selection of \nnigiri and relatively easy to get a table though \ndining area is large and relatively crowded.\nWaitperson suggested a nice white wine for \ndinner, the Merry Edwards sauvignon blanc."}

We sat at the bar and the bartender answered questions about the menu with...a high recommendation of the fish we had ordered. The black cod did not disappoint- cooked perfectly and accompanied by a delicious sauce! The bartender was attentive throughout our time at the bar at Ozumo.More"}
{"review":"Very nice restaurant with a good atmosphere, we went there with two kids and no issue. We loved the food, miso soup, sushi, maki, tempura and gyoza were great. We enjoyed also the mochi (desserts)."}
{"review":"Like the restaurant vibe and decor. The food is good but not great given how expensive it is. Not good value for the money."}
{"review":"The location is nice. The food is not bad but far away from being outstanding - the beef should be medium and was well done, as we complained the service told us that the kitchen closed already. Over all it is MUCH to expensive -...better you stay away!More"}
{"review":"It's a good sushi Restaurant but overpriced. We let the waiter select courses for our dinner, he selected $400 item of a few ounces of beef without asking us. The dinner overall was $300 per person for good not great Japanese food. The restaurant is...an attractive space and well located just not equal to the price.More"}
{"review":"My date and I went here on the Fourth of July. Both of us are of Japanese descent and  raised on its cuisine so we're both very selective about the freshness and quality. At Ozumo, it was outdoor dining at its best: great views of...the Bay Bridge and watching fireworks near the Ferry Building and  in the distance in Oakland. The former were hard to see since the fog was rolling in.  Their sushi is among the very best in the Bay Area. Recommendations: TONAI SAN SUSHI (bite size modern sushi, including lobster, shrimp, wagyu, and uni), TORO (bluefin tuna belly - we ordered it twice), NASU (grilled eggplant). Their special that day was a SAKE SASHIMI. \nThe only disappointment was the dessert: we previously tried CHOCO-CHAN (chocolate cake with Japanese whisky & banana ice-cream) and this time SURUI (sorbet); they were so-so. Better to have a nightcap (soothing chamomile tea or sake) and relax. \nOverall, a great dining experience: my date say this is her favorite restaurant in San Francisco - and she's a native of the City.More"}
{"review":"Yes, yes, yes - it was a good choice making a reservation, although the reservation process was annoying - too many questions in advance, a hell of work and communication with the restaurant. Why do I have to choose the drinks in advance.... The restaurant...and food itself were more than perfect. We really enjoyed the evening and the way the food was prepared.More"}
{"review":"We sat at the sushi bar for dinner last night and had a great time! Food was excellent and staff was attentive, pleasant and helpful. It was my sister's birthday and they brought us a very tasty ice-cream dessert. Decor is upscale, fresh and we...had such a nice evening.  We love sushi and are picky and this restaurant did not disappoint.More"}

{"review":"This a was a pleasant surprise in San Francisco. \n\nOutstanding aubergine vegetarian starter and banana dessert (see pictures). Excellent spring rolls, but just OK main courses. Attentive service combined with a very welcoming, soft atmosphere. \n\nCocktails good to very good, I would personally prefer with...slightly less dry spices and more of a lemoney or salty component to certain specific spicy cocktails (see pictures).\n\nFairly priced.More"}
{"review":"That\u2019s a sign of confidence in taste\u2026 and it\u2019s earned. They did bring a sauce for the corn fritters. Attractive atmosphere, good service, filling food. Party of 3. We enjoyed the shareable portions."}
{"review":"Food was fantastic. The meat used was good quality it was so tender when cooked and everything was cooked fresh. If I lived in San Francisco I would eat here every day. Some of the best food I have had for along time."}
{"review":"This was probably the worst device I have ever had. I brought a party of 9, and not sure if the automatically added 20% gratuity meant the server didn\u2019t care but it was awful. No one got a drink refill, Al of the dirty plates...from appetizers and dinner sat on the table until we left. No check back, no one cared. The food was ok but nothing great. I would never recommend this place.More"}

{"review":"We recently visited San Francisco for our stay-cation as we have been reading that San Francisco is re-opening due to COVID.  Many of the restaurants are still not open, however, E&O was open for both indoor and outdoor dining.  The food was great, and service...was great as well.More"}
{"review":"We had some time between appointments in the area and were looking for a snack.  We happened upon this place and just decided to stop with no information on preconception.  So glad we decided to eat here.  It's listed as Asian cuisine but definitely not...traditional with some modern additions to the flavors.  The plan was for a snack but as usual we ordered far more than we needed.  Even we could not finish the dishes.  Chicken satay was well cooked and mildly seasoned but the peanut sauce brought out the flavor even more.  Indonesian corn fritter bites were surprisingly one of our favorites.  Simple and good, especially with the sweet chili sauce.  you can't go wrong with dumplings and the shrimp and chicken siu mai was excellent.  The best for us was the steamed pork buns which is always a favorite.  The cooked yet doughy buns are a treat.  Soy-braised pork, hoisin and pickled radish slaw just add so much more to the delicious buns.  Would definitely come back here several more times if we were in the area more frequently.More"}
{"review":"As my wife and I had only one night in San Francisco we asked the desk clerk at our hotel for a dining recommendation nearby and he suggested the E&O.  We were very pleased with our experience.  The menu offers an interesting selection and we...had the lettuce cup and Pad Thai which we shared and enjoyed very much.  The sauces served with the lettuce cup allowed us to each have the level of spiciness we wanted.  The Pad Thai met all expectations and enjoyed the generous selection of ingredients.  Unlike many dining experiences for my wife this meal settled well and appreciated the freshness and preparation of our food.  The service was friendly and efficient.  Definitely would return to this restaurant if found ourselves in the area again.More"}
{"review":"Great Cheeseburger at an Asian Restaurant\n\nWe were staying around the corner from E&O Asian Kitchen at 314 Sutter St, at the edge of San Francisco\u2019s Union Square Area, on our second trip to San Francisco in July. I had read of it, on the...TripAdvisor San Francisco Destination Forum, and it always got great recommendations, so I decided to try it for lunch one day, and I was glad that I had done so.\n\nI arrived, just as they were opening for lunch, and entered, taking in the interior - it could have been a restaurant in Thailand, or many other places in Southeast Asia\/Malaysia. I spotted the bar, to the right, and rear of the dining room and the little \u201cliving room\u201d waiting area, and took a seat. The bartender was just setting up, and had the menu to me quickly.\n\nI looked over the wines B-T-G list, and decided on Laurenz V. \u201cSinging\u201d Gr\u00fcner Veltliner, from the short, but interesting wine list. I was really not in the mood for Asian, though I was seated in an Asian restaurant and bar, as we had done Thai, and Japanese for three dinners, already. Yet, I had read so much about E&O, that I was determined to eat lunch there. I mentioned my dilemma to the bartender, and he highly recommended their \u201cE&O Cheeseburger,\u201d on house-made scallion bun, with white cheddar, kim chi sriracha aioli, house-made pickles and togarashi fries. Sounded good, so I ordered that, along with a glass of Trig Point \u201cDiamond Dust\u201d Alexander Valley Cabernet Sauvignon. I hesitated over the Robert Biale Black Chicken Vineyard Zinfandel, but as I have cases of that in my cellar back in Phoenix, decided on a wine, that I had never tasted, and the Trig Point was one. Turned out to be a good pairing with the Cheeseburger.\n\nNow, the Cheeseburger is a monster, and it had to be cut, to be eaten. The burger patty was cooked perfectly, and was tasty and juicy. The bun was also very good, as were the cheddar and kim chi sriracha aioli. The fries, seemed to have been hand cut, and not out of a 25 lb sack from the freezer - a great burger, and I would rank it about #3, or 4, on my continuing \u201cBurger Quest in San Francisco.\u201d This was a burger, worth returning for, and in an Asian restaurant.\n\nThe restaurant did fill up with lunch-time diners, and it seemed that the staff knew most of them, so I would say many were returning locals - always a good sign. The noise level rose a bit, but not too badly, given the crowd. The lighting over the bar was more than adequate, and I have to give the bartender credit for still checking on me, even when the crowds picked up.\n\nThe main dining room was smallish, but looked comfortable, with good lighting too. I saw a balcony, but do not know if there was additional dining upstairs, or if this was just an architectural element?\n\nThe d\u00e9cor was very tasteful, and maybe even a tad understated - attractive.\n\nI have another lunch option in San Francisco, though our trips are winding down now, and would not hesitate to order the Cheeseburger again, even in this Asian restaurant.More"}

We saw Females wearing baseball caps backwards?? Which were not told to take them off.. Food overpriced and servers not attentive or very welcoming ..for me this place is a no go and needs a proper overall in terms of what they are trying to achieve..its based opposite the pier for alcatraz so relies on tourist trade..who guess what..Wear baseball caps and shorts ..get a grip houstonsMore"}
{"review":"Today, I went to Hillstone on the Embarcadero in SF with my wife and four children. My youngest uses a wheelchair so I asked for a table for six and let them know one in the party used a wheelchair. The hostess' expression was a...look of what I can only describe as annoyance. She consulted another hostess who then came back to us and said they had nothing that could accommodate us. This was surprising since the restaurant was 90% empty.  The second hostess said the only thing she could offer was to separate us into two tables. My wife and I discussed briefly and decided to leave.  The hostesses had no apologies or evidence of concern or regret that they could not accommodate us.  If it is true that Hillstone lacks even a single six top which could accommodate a wheelchair, then I find this a shocking lack of consideration for the millions of disabled patrons who also may seek to dine with them.   I also would recommend to the management that they provide training to their hostess team to provide a greater level of empathy and hospitality to guests they are turning away especially with an empty restaurant.  We left and all concluded even if it were true that they couldn't accommodate us, they certainly didn't act like they wanted to as no effort, creativity or concern was applied to serving us. This is the first and only time after many years of traveling and dining out with my son that I've been turned away like this from any restaurant. Very disappointing.More"}

{"review":"Sunday, July 16, 2023\n5:00-6:30pm\n\nOur worst experience at SF Hillstone ever, covering over two decades.\n\nService was slow, food was cooked incorrectly, even after two tries.\nTo top it off, the general manager, Tavia B., was extremely rude and unprofessional.\n\nWe are done with...Hillstone, after 20+ years (Houstons then Hillstone).  We visit at least twice a month, driving 30 minutes each way, spending over $500 each time, dependent on how many are in our group...family, friends, business associates.  Our bill has surpassed $2,000 on many occasions.  We even had our wedding reception there.  (Sad, I know.)  We have spent well over $50,000 in the past decade alone at SF Hillstone.\n\nWe will not even consider returning as long as the current GM of SF Hillstone, Tavia, is there.  The restaurant was unorganized and staff was untrained. These have been ongoing issues for many months, very sub-par especially for the outrageous prices.  They are embarrassments to themselves.  We were very kind and patient even though our server was clearly not trained properly.  He was very nice and we gave him all the slack he needed and we were very appreciative of his efforts.  We knew it wasn't his fault that he was untrained and the amount of staff was insufficient for the quality of service expected at Hillstone.\n\nWe managed to overlook the lack of food and service quality, chalking it up to being a Sunday. We enjoyed our evening with our elderly mother nonetheless.\n\nHowever, after dinner things got worse and very disturbing.  The general manager, Tavia, approached us and rudely accused us of being in their private area.  On our way out we stopped at a public area that has two chairs and a window overlooking the Embarcadero.  This area is directly connected to the dining room and we have been told in the past, by servers, that this area is for guests to enjoy, with a drink, just relax, wait for a table or whatever.\n\nWe stood in this public area less than a minute reminiscing how there used to be a live band.  Upon exiting the area, the general manager, Tavia, abruptly approached us and rudely told us we shouldn't be in their private area.  What?  We were NOT in a private area.\n\nWhen I asked her to please explain what she meant by \"private area\" she threw her hand up and said \"no, I'm not going to do that, leave\" and walked away.  I followed her asking her again to explain and she then called me \"crazy\" for being upset and that since I was upset I must be obviously guilty.  No, I'm upset because you have accused us of something we did not do.   We did not go into any private area...all is clearly open to the public.\n\nTavia is not a good fit for Hillstone or any public interaction in my opinion.  We have never come across anyone at Hillstone who has ever been rude.  Not even close.  Everyone is always overally pleasant.  She is a horrible employee.  How Tavia became a GM is absolutely mind-boggling.  Good help is hard to find, I know.  I imagine her employees must be suffering under her as well, if customers dislike her.\n\nTavia's staff can thank her for my boycott and the money they will not earn because she is incapable of professionalism and making their customers feel welcomed, not scolded and demeaned with false accusations.  She had a big giant smile as she falsely accused us.  Disgusting.   She didn't even want to entertain the notion that this was a misunderstanding of some sort.  She told me she was \"doing her job\".  Someone in corporarate needs to explain things to her.\n\nAll of the above doesn't even consider the fact that SF Hillstone no longer offers live band music in the evenings (since 2020).  They destroyed that entire area of the restaurant, building a big box where tables and the band resided.  They use that for storage, we were told years ago.  So, it is now a smaller, more crowded venue with no music and a horrible GM, Tavia.\n\nTime for us to try some of the many other options we are so fortunate to have in the Bay Area.\n\nThe manner in which we were treated and spoken to at SF Hillstone by current GM, Tavia, is inexcusable and unforgivable.More"}

Kind of what you would expect from a nicer, higher end restaurant.  A lot of business dinners, dates, and groups of friends all coming in here.\nIt's a little pricey at Hillstone, worth it for sure.  Hillstone is now one of my \"go0to's in SF because of the quality of the service and the quality of the food.More"}

We each enjoyed a fresh glass of Syrah, we split the absolute BEST Caesar salad ever, and also split a delicious cheeseburger with fries.  We are so glad we stopped.  However, if they take reservations and I am not sure they do, I would suggest making them prior.  Also, sitting outside would be a lovely experience, but there are not many outside tables avaialbe.

If you are a serious carnivore,  it is may be a bit different. The farofa was a treat but not  as good as we had hoped. Again Couve  was disappointing. I guess the point is if you can eat a lot of meat and want that more than a Brasilian menu than you don\u2019t really care about the buffet and just like paying a lot of $$$ to have someone bring meat to your table.  Service was great and they were very responsive to requests, but this is only for the person who wants to gorge on meat.More"}

Our only problem is despite having top quality meat... most of it tastes the same!

{"review":"If you\u2019re craving for Brazilian style meats in SF then this is the place to go. You do need reservations as it can get crowded even on week nights. The best part about a Churrascaria is you won\u2019t need to bother with the menu. You...just sit down and start eating. The salad bar was average but the seafood soup was fantastic. \n\nThe meats are the main star here and it does not disappoint. The Sirloin or Picanha is the best among all the cuts. This is the king of Brazilian cuts and it\u2019s executed perfectly. The other meat that truly impressed was the Pork Belly. It was exquisitely barbecued and the skin was crisp and tasty. Third on the list is the slow cooked short ribs. Tender and melt in your mouth. \n\nWine selection was decent and I went for the reasonably priced Argentinian Melbecs. Let it breathe a little and it is as good as any more expensive American reds. \n\nOverall it has been quite a pleasant experience and I\u2019d recommend this place to satisfy your Brazilian cravings.More"}

{"review":"This was an amazing and fun dinning experience that I had been putting off for years, but so happy I finally tried it and especially this place.\n\nSeen advertisements for ages of Brazilian meat restaurants where they walk around with scurried meats and cut it...at your table and thought it was something hokey for tourists.  Well, there is a little bit of hokeyness from the servers coming around in fancy gauchoish outfits, but the food and especially the meat is just phenomenal.\n\nSo it is all you can eat, which allows you to enjoy the items that you like and indulge in the meat gluttony that comes table side and carves you your meat right in front of you hot from the kitchen.  The quality and flavors of all the meats are just incredible.\n\nThere is the salad bar with complimenting items for your meal, along with some table breads, but try not to fill up on those as it really is all about the meat.  However, make sure you leave room for dessert.  They have some great desserts that are a bit exotic and out of the norm.  \n\nEven though the place was very busy, everyone from the hostess, to the servers, and floor manager were all very friendly and professional.  You can really tell this place knows what they are doing.\n\nWill definitely be back and don't hesitate to recommend this place.More"}

{"review":"Espetus is steak, steak and more steak.  I\u2019ve been to several Brazilian steakhouses including a few in Brazil, and I\u2019d say that Espetus is above average every time. The room is not real big, nor is it particularly well decorated.  It\u2019s somewhat spartan in fact....The emphasis here is on the meat.  The service is friendly.  At a Brazilian steakhouse, you want the meat to come out fast and furious.  Espetus checks that box every time.  As for the food, the salad bar is a decent size but nothing special.  You can find spectacular spreads in other chain joints but seriously, who cares.  You come for the meat, not the salad.  And as for the MEAT, I find it consistently well prepared and tasty.  They have a wide variety of cuts, including chicken and lamb.  It\u2019s all good.  Well prepared.  And delightful.  This is a great place for a fun date or to meet friends.  It is not cheap, but it\u2019s a treat.More"}

{"review":"Some good friends recommended this charming place on 30th street near Church St.  Note the street address carefully, it's unclear that 291 30th is even a restaurant when you look directly at it.  There is little or no signage.  My theory is that this intersection...may be SF's version of the \"Bermuda Triangle\" as there is something magical here.  A historic muni-trolley car rumbles by every so often -- making the wide turn up Church Street.  Stand at this broad intersection for a few minutes and see if you have the same sensation.\n\nStep inside the door of La Ciccia and you will encounter a heavy red drape.  Push the drape aside to find an intimate dining room and small bar.  The ambience is so romantic  I began to wonder how many marriage proposals occurred here.  Hidden away as it was, the restaurant was completely full on a cold December evening.  Those who have found this place clearly become repeat customers.\n\nCheck out the menu on their web site to see their menu.  Everything our party of five ordered was delicious.  The waiter was extremely helpful in making wine recommendations and you will find they have a very extensive selection.  A couple owns and operates the restaurant and the wife came up to personally see that we were satisfied.  It was clear that she knew most of the patrons that evening -- our party being somewhat of an outlier. \n\nI'd strongly recommend reservations for your visit given La Ciccia's obviously popularity. If you a ready to pop the question to someone special, this may be your venue!More"}

{"review":"This place definitely lived up to expectations.  It is a small restaurant in a pretty residential neighborhood.  We had a reservation, which I recommend.  They specialize in Sardinian food and ingredients.  So there are several seafood options as well as pork and some vegetarian choices....They have a pretty extensive wine list with wines from all over Italy, including Sardegna.  All of the food was amazing.  There was a special seafood pasta with a tomato and olive based sauce that was probably the star of the show.  The spaghetti with mushroom ragu was rich and delicious.  We also had an arugula salad with burrata cheese as an appetizer.  We could not try a second course because we were too full, but they had some good looking fish and pork dishes.  We did get the cheese plate, which came on a flat bread and included pecorino and fiore sardo, as well as some honey.  It is not cheap with entree courses starting at $25 per plate, but worth the splurge.  Wines start at around $14 per glass or $45 per bottle.More"}

The lamb was drowned in herbs & balsamic sauce--so much so that the flavor of the lamb barely came through, and the cauliflower was spicy without being notified in advance. The room was stuffy and loud. On top of the food misses, it was overpriced. With so many perfect, unpretentious, Italian restaurants in San Francisco, like Tony's, Pazzia, Perbacco, Delfina, The Italian Homemade Company, and a slew of others, we had hoped for a Sardinian restaurant.More"}

That's the only reason I rated this a 3.\n\nThen it took about 15 minutes and 4 different requests from 4 different people to get my check.  \n\nIt was only when I got up and appeared to be leaving (when in fact, I was at the host stand to get a menu so I could just pay cash and leave!) that a server came running up to me (then I get the attention!) and acted like he was afraid I was leaving.\n\nAfter he returned with the check, I did something I've never done in my entire life.  I put a big fat ZERO for the tip.  Shocked, he was and said something about the tip.  I said, \"Who should I give a tip to? The person who never checked back on me?  The one who never asked if I wanted to take any home?  Or any of the FOUR servers I had to ask for the check?\"  \n\nI'd probably go back if I had someone else to even out the importance, but then again, I think of all the other restaurants that don't act like a solo woman isn't going to tip, and I think I'll patronize them instead.More"}
{"review":"We stopped at Delarosa on our bikes after a long ride around San Francisco.     Locked bikes on nearby bike stand and sat street side with our dog.  We shared a beet salad, My wife enjoyed pappardelle w\/napolitana sauce & I had Fennel Sausage pizza.  I...had a beer & my wife had a Salty Dog.  We shared Molten chocolate cake w\/vanilla gelato for dessert.  Excellent food!  Great service!More"}
{"review":"Great bartender. This place is frequented by the young crowd in the Marina. A sandwich, chicken parm, 3 house wines, 2 beers fo $86.00. Food was good, not over-the-top. We can understand that the locals like this place. Worth a return."}
{"review":"We saw this restaurant the last time we went out for dinner in the center and saw a line outside waiting to get in.  We figured the next time we would have to try it.  Well it didn\u2019t disappoint.  We had appetizers which consisted of...mussels and the other was burrata bruschetta which were both delicious.  I had the linguini with calamari that tasted sooo gooooood!  I had a taste of my wife\u2019s pizza the margherita with burrata and was equally good.  We\u2019ll define coming back to try more of the menu.More"}
{"review":"This is a fantastic pizza place in the heart of the Marina district. If you are stuck at a conference downtown, do yourself a favour and jump into a taxi to Chestnut Street in the Marina district to see the nice side of San Francisco....Lots of nice restaurants and bars, including this great pizza place. Service was fantastic and my pizza was very tasty.More"}
{"review":"This restaurant probably deserves a 5 rating but I reserve those for only the very best. But this restaurant is not far behind that rating - great pizza, salads, cocktails and service! What more can you ask for? Don't be shy about customizing your pizza,...they're very accommodating. We will return.More"}
{"review":"This was a fun place to stop as we walked a Chestnut Street at lunch time.  We were early but we were not alone for long because it filled up very quickly keeping the attentive staff hopping.  We tried Dungeness crab arancini with a Calabrian...dip that were small and easy to share before our pizzas, one the traditional margarita and the second a fungi pizza.  Both arrived piping hot and were delicious...they were large enough to feed three and take the remainder away for a later snack.  We sat next to a party of little girls celebrating a birthday and it made the atmosphere all the more fun.More"}
{"review":"Went here with colleagues after a drinks event nearby. They were able to seat 12 of us quickly (at side by side tables) which was great as it's small and we got there at a peak time for dinner. Meatballs, brussell sprouts and pizza were...all delicious. Good service.More"}
{"review":"My daughter treated me to my birthday lunch at Delarosa and it was a very enjoyable meal. We sat at the bar, and the bar tender took our order and offered very nice service. We shared a burrata toast starter which was so delicious and...filling that I could have made a meal out of that and a side salad. We then had the red and golden beet kale salad. While quite fresh and pretty, it was rather bland. The dressing seemed to be just oil with no vinegar added. A little tartness would have been nice. Then we shared the potato, proscuitto, provolone pizza which was divine. I love the airy, bubbly crust. I'm sure we'll be back for another meal !\n\nThe restaurant is quite popular and was busy with couples and many families with children on a Saturday, but since we chose to sit at the bar we didn't have to wait.More"}
{"review":"Really popular place with locals etc, good atmosphere, well attentive staff accompanied by really tasty food, one to visit!"}
{"review":"Stepping into Big 4 is like stepping into another time. The decor is wood and leather and dark. The tables are oddly placed, and you might be facing another person at another table just a little too close for comfort. But that's okay, you're there...for the food.\n\nThe standout dish is the chicken pot pie. But I've had their steak and their french onion soup which was also good, too. The menu is on the heavier side so don't expect a light salad with kombucha broth. This is a restaurant for anniversaries, celebrations, and people who want a ritzy night on the town.\n\nService is professional, too.More"}
{"review":"We have been here several times for drinks before a show at The Masonic, we already know service is very slow at the bar area. We had breakfast here after staying at The Huntington Hotel. Wow, the service was bad!  The food was also disappointing....Breakfast took almost 2 hours.  The poor server clearly had not been trained and was literally running back and forth. Not sure if it was staffing or if she was brand new. The food took over one hour to get to the table after ordering. One of the orders came with bacon instead of ham, my friend who is a benedict fan said his eggs benedict was so-so, the sauce seemed to be more butter than hollandaise sauce.  My omelet was meh, nothing special and she forgot the avocado. Not sure what was going on in the kitchen, but the poor server was having a tough morning. Disappointing.More"}
{"review":"When we stopped in without a reservation before a show at the Masonic, there was no way even to wait for a table.  So we just sat down and ordered bar food.  This is a cozy place to have a drink and talk.  You don't...have to perch yourself on a bar stool.  They have padded leather captain's chairs.\n\nBest dishes are chicken pot pie and hamburger.  Savor the food and enjoy the drink at your leisure.  It will make you want to miss the show next door!More"}
{"review":"I am just going to throw out some ideas and you can what you want with it.\n\nOld school.\nGreat decor and dark leathery feel to it.\nPricey.\nNothing vegetarian....even the salads are laden with bacon.\nHost attitude.\nPricey.\nService is ok."}
{"review":"Atmosphere is beautiful old style San Francisco with dark wood and leather booths. Love the ambiance. We were here for Christmas evening so it was a pre-fixe menu with 3 options per course. Food was very expensive for the quality and quantity. I started with...a mushroom risotto that was ok....just didn\u2019t have a lot of flavor and preparation wasn\u2019t quite there either. Wouldn\u2019t recommend. My wife had a lobster bisque was also was ok. Bisque had a lobster flavor due to using the shells in the stock but no signs of any lobster at all. Wouldn\u2019t recommend. I had the lamb chops which were from Colorado. They were on the small side for Colorado lamb and there were just 2 of them.  I mentioned the small portion and they brought out another. The chops were very good and enjoyed them. My wife had the filet which she enjoyed but wasn\u2019t great. Bread pudding for dessert was excellent! Service was attentive and friendly.More"}
{"review":"Fabulous dinner for four of us here. This is fine dining and you'll want to dress up for a visit to this restaurant. The restaurant itself is very traditional, old world San Francisco style. Two of us had the filet mignon, one the chicken pot...pie and one the short rib dinner. We were all more than pleased with our meals. The filet mignon was over-the-top delicious! We would highly recommend the Caymus Special Edition 2014 Cabernet Sauvignon to go along with the filet mignon. If you are lucky enough to get Phil as your waiter, he'll take great care of you! We will be back!!More"}
{"review":"I had one of the best sandwiches at the Big 4.  I've been there several times before and always have a very good meal.  I had the chicken wrap and every bite was amazing.  I love a good sandwich!"}
{"review":"When in San Francisco, I dress up a bit and head to the The Big 4. As soon as you step through the door into the piano bar you\u2019re transported back to a gracious era, and are steeped in SF history. The cocktail bar ambiance...is perfect, and the food is locally sourced, seasonal and well prepared.More"}
{"review":"For 30 years this has been our favorite place in San Francisco! It is one of the last beautiful Old World dining venues left. As with most wonderful places, it is the the people who work there that 'tie the ribbon' on the jewelbox of...a dining room and bar. Ron, our waiter for over 15 years years now, is priceless. All the staff are wonderful. Martin, doesn't just stand around and manage, but is a constant blur of activity making sure that everyone is tended to and all is well. The venison we had last Saturday it was fantastic! Keep that wild game coming! There have been some ups and downs through changes in ownership Etc, but through it all, it has been the longtime staff that has steadied the ship. Only one thing I would ask..PLEASE...\nAfter 30 years of always being welcomed and walking through the lobby into the Big Four,someone has suddenly decided to shut the doors between the lobby and the restaurant. Hearing the elegant sound of the piano quietly in the background as you came in, always drew people's attention to the beautiful Bar and Restaurant. Not only does it now feel unwelcoming as if they are trying to keep people out, but the doors are heavy and you then have to go up the stairs and pull open heavy doors just to enter the restaurant and lounge.\nFor all these years the doors were open and welcoming ... So if someone would please, pretty please, heed the old adage \"if it ain't broke...\" \u2764More"}
{"review":"My wife and I again had dinner at the Big 4 Restaurant on our latest visit to San Francisco. After a drink from the world's best bartender, we were seated at a corner table by our terrific server. The green leather, dark wood decor is...fabulous. I had the 16 oz pork chop and my wife their signature chicken pot pie both of which were delicious. The lemon creme brulee dessert was fantastic. The service at the Big 4 is alwys the best: attentive but not intrusive. The Big 4 is perfect restaurant for that special night with your spouse or date.More"}
{"review":"I like to keep our nicest restaurant during trips for the last day.  This is in the Huntington Hotel on Knob Hill.  Live piano player greets.  Furnishings and trim are from the turn of the last century.  Oyster appetizer OK, salads were very good, cioppino...was excellent, pork chop was also just as good but the flourless chocolate cake was, by far, the best we have ever had.  Not cheap eats here but the quality and service were excellent.More"}
{"review":"LOVED the unique entrance to this classic old San Francisco spot.  The piano, the bar seating and the ambience is terrific!  We sat for dinner in the main dining room which is very attractive, where the service was attentive and professional.  However, I found the...food to be mediocre.  There is nothing that we ordered that I need to go back again to enjoy (the group had the antipasti platter, the tomato\/burrata app, King salmon, pot pie and cioppino).  My guests were frquent visitors to the restaurant and had to send the pot pie back for a new pastry top as it was not cooked and soggy.  Other than that, very average.  I would recommend sitting in the bar area to enjoy cocktails with the music and basic apps.  THIS is what you are hearing about.More"}
{"review":"I had the chance to experience the Big 4 several times while staying at the Huntington hotel in August entertaining business associates and family.\n\nBreakfast was very nice - lots of options but the Eggs Benedict are really delicious. In the evening a favorite of...our group was the chicken pot pie with port. Very warm clubby atmosphere and an excellent piano player makes the evening very festive.More"}
{"review":"Realizing that Handsome Companion\u2019s recently-widowed sister might want company for dinner one of the evenings Handsome Companion\u2019s family would not be getting together during a recent mini-reunion in San Francisco, I reached out to her.  When she said she was free Friday evening, I immediately...booked the three of us for dinner at Big 4.\n\nWe met at 5:30 p.m., good for H. C. and me because, our body clocks were still on East Coast time.  And it would give the three of us a chance to exhale, catch up, and enjoy one another\u2019s company before the onslaught of the activities with the larger group of family members the next afternoon. \n\nWe started with three glasses of ice-cold and delicious Prosecco. The atmosphere of Big 4 is so conducive to just relaxing, being in good company, and enjoying good conversation. The lights are low, conversations are muted, and the service is excellent but not intrusive. \n\nThe menu at Big 4 is not extensive, but there is enough to please most palates.  H.C. chose for his starter the beets and goat cheese salad.  It was beautiful and tasty. I started with the Little Gems Wedge, minus the Lardons (one needs some limits!). It was wonderful. For  his main course, H. C. had the King Salmon, and I had the lamb chops. SIL had the filet mignon.  Each was delicious. \n\nOur dinner lasted almost three hours, accompanied by magnificent piano music. Big 4 is a special place.More"}

{"review":"We spent a week in San Francisco.  While there we stopped in at Wipeout for a beer and lunch.  We sat at the bar and chatted with the bartender.  the establishment was relaxed and comfortable.  The food portions were large, we could have shared something....I enjoyed the salmon BLT, my husband had a burger.  All the food was very good and delivered in a timely fashion.\nWe enjoyed the it so much we went back another day to enjoy a few beers.  Again we sat at the bar and chatted with the bartender.  Both bartenders were friendly & knowledgeable.  I have to say........bartenders can make or break the experiences.

The staff aren't rushed off their feet and were very attentive. We were served by Morgan and she was friendly and attentive....Gave us time to order and no rushing of us to eat up and go.

{"review":"I gave the rating a  two solely for the food.  The dim sum was very tasty as well as the main course we ordered.  The waiter was scarcely seen and the place was very noisy.  We interacted more with the staff bringing our dishes than...with the waiter.  When the waiter brought the bill he had the tenacity to tell us that the 20% service charge did not include him.  Sorry, but you're already telling me that I gave 20% for okay service.More"}
{"review":"Agree with other reviews that it feels a bit cluttered and rushed.  Great idea that you tick off what you want on the menu to prevent confusion.  We were advised by the waiter to have 3 -4 options to share so we went for 3...which was more than enough, could have got away with one dish each.  We were overlooking the staff cooking dim sum located on stools at a counter top, not the best of seating.  As soon as we were finished the bill was brought over with 20% service charge automatically included.  Felt this meal was a bit expensive for what we had.  Although it did all taste lovely and was cooked very well.More"}
{"review":"Great vibe and mix of clientele.  Staff was warm, friendly, and helpful. I felt right at home.  Food was imaginative and good with a few excellent dishes (shaved Mango ice dessert is a real winner). The interspersed gift shop was attractive and helped make the...atmosphere upbeat and fun.  Will definitely try to dine there with my family on my next trip to San Francisco!More"}

It was very busy when we arrived, and stayed busy throughout - it all felt a bit...chaotic and rushed. Food arrived at different times, so we ended up not really eating together. Staff were very pleasant and attentive. Food itself was ok, but not wow compared to what we've eaten in other European cities and in China itself. A nice night, but not very relaxing and maybe better for friends and groups rather than familiesMore"}

Amazing server who was super helpful with the menu and guiding us on dishes and portions. We had a chicken and seared steak...dish with satay chicken and the pork buns and it was amazing.\nThe only negative was the upstairs bar at the beginning of the night, we were told to head up to the bar whilst our table was cleared but it was chaos upstairs with sulky staff and also cost us $30 for two beers - what!!!! \nHowever China Live was brilliant but give the upstairs bar a miss!More"}
{"review":"Our Hotel staff recommended China Live for great Chinese food. Ordered ahead over the phone and grabbed an Uber. Extensive wait to pick up the Kung Pao chicken and dumplings. Back at the hotel we discovered the dishes were average in quality.

I was coming...to visit and booked a table immediately to invite my good friends to taste one of the best Italian cuisine in town.\n\nWe were five and that gave us a good sampling number, we ordered my favorites, Grilled Monterey Calamari, warm olives, deviled eggs, swordfish and a glorious grilled whole fish of the day. We had two pasta to share.  The buttermilk penna cotta for a non-desert eater like me was a very nice way to finish the meal.. It was an excellent dinner with superb food, professional service and in a beautifully finished dining room. \n\nCongratulations to Annie and Craig Stoll, thank you for bringing Delfina back!More"}
{"review":"A vibrant Italian restaurant, same owner to the next door of tartine. Good food good dessert, good service.\n\nSee you some day again."}
{"review":"After hearing about Delfina for a few years, I had the opportunity to go there with clients. Good thing we had reservations as the place filled up to capacity quickly with a line out the door. The service was excellent, the food was very good....The menu was limited, not a huge selection, but that is the ambiance of the of the place. We tried just about everything as we shared appetizers, mains, and deserts. Our server also recommended an Italian wine that was right on par with the type of wine I told him I was looking for.\nIt was a very enjoyable dinner.More"}
{"review":"We were staying in the locality and this restaurant came up as one of the best.  And it didn't disappoint.  Lovely bread from the nearby Tartine Bakery (only complaint - please let us have soft butter to spread on it, not hard).  I ordered White...Peach Bellini.  Peach liqueur made in house. The best peach Bellini ever! Great chicory salad (please more pear) and spaghetti with tomato and chilli was delicious. Roasted chicken with olive oil mash was also declared real good.  Don't go home without trying the little apple donuts - a real treat.More"}
{"review":"Delfina is extremely popular for their great food and excellent atmosphere so, if you don't book in advance you might not get in. Great Italian food, excellent drink options and a friendly helpful staff make for a reliably comfortable and enjoyable dinner experience."}
{"review":"Amazing simple italian food executed incredibly. Their famous Spaghetti are just as described, unbelievable. We ordered two dinner packages that had ravioli with ragu and a meet platter with sausages, ribs and some kind of stake. Tricolor salad was amazing with pancetta inside had a...really food touch to the flavor. Tartine bread and butter amazing. Great food and great time!More"}
{"review":"Really good Italian food. Pasta, meet balls, side dishes, tricolore salad. Straight to the point with falvors. Service could be a bit better, faster and more attentive but the food is excellent!"}
{"review":"Had dinner here our first night in SF and were not disappointed.  Our waiter was helpful and friendly, he was able to give us good information as we navigated both the wine and the dinner menu.  Originally I was excited to try the Sunday Supper...but then I feared it might just be a bit too much food so we both ordered the spaghetti along with a salad for me and the Tartine bread to share.  The pasta was cooked perfectly and the sauce was wonderful.  I would definitely come back and the next time, we will just go for it and order the big old Sunday Supper.More"}
{"review":"Delfina\u2019s is the perfect neighborhood restaurant with outdoor seating but so many waiting,l there\u2019s always someone you know. That camaraderie is important to the success of the restaurant; it\u2019s not just incredibly good Italian food, it\u2019s a neighbor. The prices are fair, the food is...delicious and generously portioned and your neighbors are here! What\u2019s not to like?\u2019More"}
{"review":"We had reservations at Delfina, my first time there.  We arrived at 5:30 and by 6:00 there were no more tables, the quality obviously was reflected.   The pasta was super, great salad, and really really good wine.  The waiter was super knowledgeable, friendly, professional, and...prompt.  A fantastic dinner, for my first night in San Francisco.  Check it out!More"}

{"review":"Restaurant didn't open until 5:30pm, so stood in line outside for about 20 minutes as we were meeting someone that recommended this restaurant. I ordered the steak and fries. I thought that the food was good. I'm not from this area, was just visiting so...not sure I would go out of my way to come back if in the area again, but thought it was good, no complaints.More"}
{"review":"Had a quick dinner there. Staff is friendly. Pizza and pasta are good, but the wine was awful. Go for beer or any other drink."}

{"review":"Top of the Mark in San Francisco is an iconic destination for cocktail enthusiasts seeking panoramic views and classic elegance. The bar\u2019s location atop the historic InterContinental Mark Hopkins Hotel provided breathtaking vistas of the city skyline and the Bay Area. The cocktail menu is...a creative fusion of classic and signature drinks, expertly crafted by skilled mixologists. Each cocktail is a work of art, with attention to detail in both presentation and flavor profiles. The live music and the 360-degree views of San Francisco added to the sophistication of the atmosphere, making it an ideal spot for an evening of relaxation and conversation. The attentive staff\u2019s dedication to personalized service ensures that every visit is a memorable one. Top of the Mark is not just a bar; it\u2019s a destination for those looking to savor the finestMore"}
{"review":"We enjoyed a couple beverages at the bar. We had light bites just prior to closing so not sure it\u2019s fair that we rate the food. Bartender was great & engaging. Wine list was nice! The views are amazing\u2026.till the fog rolls in."}
{"review":"This is an older hotel but we had a fantastic stay. \nThe views from the bar which is situated on the top floor are spectacular.\nVery comfortable beds staff were incredibly helpful.\nIt is at the top of steep hills but we walked down every...morning.\nWe did  walk back up a few times or just get transport back.More"}
{"review":"We took an elevator to the top of the Mark Hopkins IHG Hotel.  This is conveniently located at the intersection of the Powell and California St. cable car lines. The Top of the Mark is a large lounge that occupies the entire top floor with...large windows and offers a 360 view of San Francisco.  We went later in the day to catch the sunset.  Although this is a sophisticated bar, many people were dressed very casually.  This somewhat diminished the atmosphere of being something special. The bar is very capable and well stocked. We ordered a Vieux Carre, which tastes a lot like a very good Manhattan. This is a New Olean\u2019s drink, but they knew how to make it there! This is a very romantic, yet expensive, place for a date. Go anyway.More"}
{"review":"Nice place for a cocktail or two! Great views of SF and surrounding area. Staff are friendly and prices are reasonable as well. Just for the views it\u2019s worth visiting."}
{"review":"We enjoyed the view and had a nice appetizer, which made up for the very rude hostess. (There is no reason for it). Sadly though, the venue itself is a let down: it is badly in need of renovation. There is a photo of the...bar in its glory days, and it\u2019s a shame to see what it has become. Nevertheless, it\u2019s a place that has historic value and worth visiting for the great views.More"}
{"review":"I was stationed across the Bay in Alameda with the US Navy, I have never known about this until a work colleague told me about it. Just WOW, great people, awesome views and a cabinet just off of the elevators full of bottles that other...US service members purchased and stored for other veterans to share a shot. An unforgettable time!More"}
{"review":"We stopped into the markets at the top! Beautiful view, however, the bartender \u201cDerek\u201d is rude and not customer focused."}
{"review":"Beautiful panoramic views.  Good place for coffee and dessert though limited menu.  Atmosphere was elegant but cozy."}
{"review":"Remarkable panoramic views of San Francisco and the bay. Intimate atmosphere. Unfortunately no late dining."}
{"review":"It\u2019s a real treat to visit the Top,of the Mark.  I always dress up as it\u2019s special, but most people are casual.  The bartenders are extra nice.  As a single, I always sit at the bar and meet berym8nterewting people."}
{"review":"Here's where you should take that perfect sunset cocktail (or two) before dinner. Old-fashioned, excellent service and a view to die for."}
{"review":"We were really excited to relax with a cocktail and take in the panoramic views in this iconic San Francisco venue.  But wow, what a disappointment.  Yes, the views are spectacular, but it can be quite difficult to get a seat near the windows. The...worst thing about the experience was the noise level. It's mobbed with tourists, including lots of families with young children, and it sounds like a high school cafeteria.  And don't expect elegance--you'll see nothing but tourists in jeans, t-shirts and tennis shoes.  The drinks and food are ridiculously overpriced, and the servers are cold and aloof.  Don't go to Top of the Mark expecting old-world sophistication, because you won't find it.More"}
{"review":"Came here twice in a week - the first time by myself on business and was served an excellent margherita by a very friendly barkeep. Taco's were many, varied and quite tasty. Later in the week I took along a friend after telling them about...the margherita - but a different barkeep and a much poorer experience. Food only ok this time. Would give it 3.5 if I could but 3 as I was disappointed with consistency. Place was busy both nights - so what do I know!More"}
{"review":"Lovely tacos, guacamole and margaritas. What more could you want from a Mexican?! Staff were friendly and helpful."}
{"review":"Ok food but definitely not above average. Terrible service from a lazy bartender. She couldn't be bothered to clean the bar counters or serve guests and was too busy doing prep work. Wouldn't go back for any reason."}
{"review":"The good news: Matador\u2019s food is good, and there are many vegetarian options. My mezcal margarita was good too.\nThe bad news: Service was almost comically bad. It took 10 minutes for my waiter to take my order, and he literally never returned. The result...is that my food arrived before my drink-or even a glass of water-and I only got those after heading to the hostess desk twice to seek assistance. \nOne final note: I ate outdoors. It is a charmless seating area on a busy street, and not especially pleasant. \n\nI will not be back.More"}
{"review":"Matador is one of our favorite Mexican restaurants in San Francisco. Everything we've had on their menu has been delicious.  And we've been there quite a few times, especially for Happy Hour!\n\nThe guacamole, salsas and chips, chicken tinga and carnitas tacos, potato flautas are...among our favorites, but seriously try everything. The Margaritas are very good, if not a bit sweet, but tasty.\n\nThe staff especially Maira, Tom, Fernando and Anastacia are all very helpful and friendly. Kudos to Leo and Jamie.\n\nThe ambience has always had a chill fun vibe. I definitely would recommend Matador and look forward to our next visit.More"}
{"review":"Really excellent food and margaritas!  I especially enjoyed tamales, which I can't find at home in London. We sat at the bar and the staff were friendly and attentive.  Will definitely add this to our list of places we return to!"}
{"review":"Our first night jn SF and we were looking for dinner near our hotel. It was delicious and wait staff was very friendly! I enjoyed my margaritas."}
{"review":"Delicious burritos and friendly but efficient service. Good value. We came back the next day after our initial visit for the same meal again! Nice Michelada."}
{"review":"Holy Moley what a lovely tacos we had here!\nThe place itself is not super big, even though there\u2019s a nice atmosfere inside.\nThe tacos were fresh and super tasty.\nThe staff has been super friendly to us.\nDefinitely coming back when I\u2019ll be next...in SFO.\nThank you!More"}
{"review":"Nachos where so full and loaded, tacos where amazing but beef was a little dry pork was the best, so kind and nice staff. Would love to go again."}
{"review":"First off I'd just like to say that the food was absolutely delicious when we eventually got it and made the wait worth it, but boy was that wait long.\n\nWe sat down and within a minute our server came and asked if we were...ready to order. We'd barely had a chance to look at the menu yet so just placed our drink orders and asked for a few more minutes to look at the food. 15 minutes later we managed to flag them down again and ask for advice on how many tacos to get (suggestion is 2-3 per person depending on how hungry you are) and upon ordering was immediately told the first 3 things we tried to order were out of stock. They then gave us a list of all of the things that they were out of, and said they'd give us some more time to decide when all of our first preferences were out. Another 20 minutes passed before we could catch their attention again and finally placed our food orders.\n\nAt this point we still didn't have our drinks, and another server came over and whispered to them to pass on the message that the drink my husband wanted they couldn't make that evening. It then took another 10 minutes for us to actually get our drinks once my husband had picked a new one.\n\nI'm not sure why they didn't just tell us up front the things they were out of stock of. One of the out of stock dishes was even something our server recommended to us!\n\nOnce the food orders were actually placed we received it in 10 minutes and as I said above it was delicious, but I cannot fathom what was happening with their service.  The only reason I'm giving them a 4\/5 is because the food was just that good, and as we weren't in a hurry the quality of the food is more important.More"}
{"review":"Nove atmosphere and liked the taco\u2019s. Recommended when you stay nearby.! Loved the pastor and camRones taco\u2019s. Also the Fish pastor"}
{"review":"Discovered this place purely by accident. Great atmosphere and super friendly staff. The happy hour prices are amazing and the food and cocktails are superb value. We had an amazing time and really enjoyed our first experience to Matador. We will definitely be returning and...can honestly highly recommend this place. Special mention to our server Harrison who was outstanding.More"}
{"review":"Was just here last week and the tacos were great, as was the service.\n\nDo note, we don't look at service during or after Covid as ALL restaurants are struggling to survive with less than a 35% profit margin and why over 100 thousand of...U.S. restaurants (from a documentary) went out of business during Covid. Some, great family owned across the country we've dined in. \n\nSo, net is, we're much more forgiving dining in the U.S. and globally. \n\nOur tacos we had here last week were great! And so was our service. A local favorite and will be back. \n\nDO note, prices are higher here as it's a major U.S. city versus getting a taco or other ethnic restaurant food outside of a major city.More"}

We were appalled that they would treat long time customers like this. It will be awhile before we enter their doors again especially after spending 300 dollar\u2019s frequently at this establishment and they treat you like this!!! The table we asked for earlier sat empty throughout our dinner, go figure.More"}

The restaurant d\u00e9cor is elegant. The settings were fine china and  silver...very elegant. . I could...outline our meal but no need. Everything was cooked and presented well. The wine selection was very good as well. Will be returning when next in San Francisco.More"}
{"review":"We booked randomly at the last minute but were delighted we did.\n\nProbably some of the best service we\u2019ve had on the West Coast - okay, bar not high for that, but still very good. Old school Italian, professional, charming, humour. A bit New York,...but worked very well.\n\nFood was equally great. We kept it simple with pasta and desserts but the pasta was super well executed - not complicated but just very well done. Desserts were equally good. Oh and they had gluten free pasta as well!More"}
{"review":"We ate here on our recent trip to SF for our wedding anniversary. \n\nThe pasta was great and my red wine (sangiovese) was amazing.\n\nThe service was amazing and the owner(?)\/manager was very nice. After our meal when we called\/were waiting on an uber the...owner\/manager gentleman came outside and thanked us again for joining them for dinner and wished us a happy anniversary again. He also was checking that we were able to call an uber or if we needed directions. \n\nOur waitress (I apologize - I forget her name) was also very helpful and offered to take pictures of us in the restaurant. A very sweet gesture!\n\nWe'll be back when we return to SF with my parents in the fall!More"}

{"review":"PROS\nExcellent selection of wines: this has to be underlined since it is not that easy to get some specific wine I had the chance to have. And they also have an excellent selection of liquors with several Italian rarities. Food was okay in quantity...and overall good.\nExcellent service, amazing place, location is superb.\n\nCONS\nEven if meat \/ fish and desserts were excellent, I had pasta and it was not the definitely best pasta I had in my life - but I also understand it is hard to make a real carbonara off from Italy\n\nRecommended Italian Restaurant in California, probably the best I have been in the whole West CoastMore"}

{"review":"We were able to make a last minute reservation which we appreciated as others were busy and not taking reservations.\n\nHowever, for a cost of $140 for two main courses and two glasses of wine we felt that the experience was not worth it.   The...restaurant was very noisy (including a group singing Happy Birthday) and it was difficult to have a conversation.\n\nMy friend noticed that a fork was dirty and asked for it to be replaced.  The server initially looked at it and said it was not dirty.  My friend pointed out a piece of food attached and the server then replaced the fork.   Amazing that in a \"quality\" restaurant one should have to argue with staff over this!\n\nA server brought the main dishes and stated that my friend's plate was saltimbocca.  He said that was not what he ordered and then the server confirmed that in fact the dish was what was ordered.   Again, a misstep.\n\nOverall it was a bit of a relief to finish dinner and leave.More"}
{"review":"We were in the city on a Sunday afternoon around 8pm. Seemed like every restaurant we wanted to go was closed. Luckily this little place was close to our hotel and open. The server was super nice and accommodating. We had lasagna, ravioli and a...sandwich. I have had better Italian food for sure but this place was good. We were thankful for the hospitality we received more than anything.More"}
{"review":"Suggested by friends because of its convenient location our group of six adults went for dinner.\n   The decor and ambiance is kind of old fashioned, dim but comfortable. The all male wait staff look like characters out of the Godfather; older gruffly speaking with dark...suits and lots of gold bracelets, watches and rings.\n   The food was terrible to adequate. The house salad was a mess of wilted lettuces very overly dressed. The broiled fish was dry, The pastas were large bowls of flavorless noodles, The Chicken Picata was very large and generous but nothing special there.\n   Being located in the heart of San Francisco's Italian district I venture to say that there are other better alternatives for Italian dining.More"}

The service was horrible and the restaurant was dirty. One of two toilets was clogged with paper towels. The...bottom of my wineglass was dirty. The waiter never returned to check on us or offer more wine. It was a Monday night, and they were not busy. My best experience was walking out the door.More"}
{"review":"I set up a Christmas lunch for party of 10.  I called 2 times to make sure they had the reservation and asked both times that we'd get the LUNCH menu for 3 pm res.  Of course, they say....well they pulled a fast one.  Sat...down around 3:05ish and got the DINNER menu because, \"our computers turn over at 3 pm and there is nothing we can do.\"  Needless to say I wasn't happy from the start.\n\nWaiter suggested an appetizer of burrata, prosciutto and small lobster bite; we agreed thinking it was a shared dish....plates came individually to us and when we got the bill were charged $31 pp!  \n\nBefore this, we ordered; some of us ordered appetizers or salads not realizing we were getting the individual burrata plates....did they inform us of this?? NO.  They just want to make your bill as high as possible.\n\nSo many plates came that we each had to at time hold each others empty plates because there was no room on the table.\n\nWe inquired about a Barbera wine suggestion....oh, they had one!  Came out and poured....but failed to tell us it was $140 per bottle!  Ditto with the $95 Chardonnay....\n\nThe bill came with the 20% tip included.  Bill was $1100.  and two of us shared an entree and one of us didn't even have an entree.  Needless to say, we didn't include the tip...Waiter finally got attentive....but his only interest was upcharging us as much as possible for the biggest tip.  \n\nContacted management to tell them about our awful experience and got, \"spoke with our staff and they followed procedures\".  Really???\n\nFood was mediocre; best part of the place is the ambience but they did squish our party into a table not big enough for 10....\n\nWord of advice:  don't go!More"}

We were taken downstairs to an dark empty room, when we said we did not like to be the only people in a room we were told a party of ten was coming as were others,...the party of ten arrived no one else ..a party of three had been seated upstairs before us and a party of three behind us were never seen again - assume they and everyone else got to sit in the dining room.   Waiter must have had a fight with his wife - rude, pushy and totally uninterested in his job tried to get us to order most expensive items, food arrived within seconds, plates cleared before others at table had finished, pasta puttanesca had no olives, never had one or seen a recipe without olives, waiter said it was \u201csouthern Italy\u201d \nRisotto has about half an inch of liquid oil  in the bowl.

We arrived around 15 minutes late and we were scolded by the hostess. We were told another table was booked behind us and that we basically did NOT need to take our time.

{"review":"I really wanted to go back to one of the 3 Michelin Star restaurants here in the Bay to celebrate my birthday, unfortunately, all were fully booked despite that I have tried to book 2 months in advance.  Been to all 3 Michelin stars in...the Bay Area so no big deal.  We ended up here which was not a bad choice.  This is our 2nd visit and our first experience was excellent 5 years ago.  \n\nTo start with, the place has not changed much.  Still looking a bit plain inside, but the service is still impeccably excellent.  Food was good, but 5 years ago, it was excellent (I also reviewed).  \n\nFood presentation was very good.  Taste wise, almost every dish was good except the main dish - lamb.  It looked so good, unfortunately, it was too tangy and too salty for our taste.  \n\nIn the middle of our last dish, our waiter delivered my supposedly complimentary birthday cake.  Instead, he made a mistake and delivered an anniversary cake which was supposed to be for the other table.  I didn\u2019t bother telling him as not to embarrass him.  Afterwards, I saw him delivered my birthday cake to the other table which the wife uttered \u201cIt\u2019s not my birthday\u201d.  I was rather disappointed that two reckless mistakes happened.  Please double check and pay more close attention where to send the birthday cake, anniversary cake, etc.  After all, these important celebrations are some of the reasons why such as myself dine here.More"}
{"review":"I'm pretty shocked to be writing this review and even more saddened I was treated so poorly I will never dine at Acquerello again. My first experience was about 10 years ago, and I was turned away as I was dressed too casually. I was...mortified and embarrassed and since then (I've been a half dozen times) I make sure to follow their formal dress code. The night before my reservation this week I was even called to emphasize the dress code--and I appreciated that touch, knowing I was in for a special evening. So I was literally shocked when the hostess seated a man in a t-shirt in front of me during my meal. I tried to follow up with one of the owners the next day. First I was told I was not allowed to speak to an owner. Then I was told \"it's 2022. We don't follow a strict dress code anymore.\" Well, maybe you could have told me that the night before when I was called and told the opposite.\nDinner for two was $900 and I was seated next to someone who could have just as easily be eating at McDonald's. You used to go to Acquerello for the experience or else why bother? A picture is worth 1,000 words. I was told I wasn't allowed to speak to an owner. Perhaps the owners read reviews.More"}
{"review":"I am delighted to report that Acquerello has not been part of a trend of rapidly declining service standards that seems to have accelerated and been used as an excuse in the time of Covid.\n\nInstead, Acquerello may be one of the last great dining...institutions in a city that is known to set a worldwide standard for outstanding food.\n\nThe dining room itself is meticulously maintained and is absolutely lovely- beautiful fresh flower arrangements, wonderful furnishings, well-pressed linens, beautiful china, and well-spaced tables.   Well-spaced tables seem to have gone by the wayside as a standard for a first-class restaurant.  Fortunately, Acquerello has maintained this standard.  This alone allows for the ability to have a conversation at your table without shouting and is a great feature during Covid.  Did I mention they have linen?!  \n\nWith the leadership of the amazing Isabella Paterlini, the service is absolutely superb.  Friendly, warm, elegant, and unobtrusive.  The choreography is a pleasure to observe.  The team that made it happen for our evening was exceptional- Kevin Lee as General Manager was in the dining room throughout working in tandem with a superb group of people.  Even the busser had an elegance that rivaled a food server in most upscale restaurants.  Davide who presided over our table was also especially charming and had an exceptional knowledge of the extensive dishes that were presented during our meal.  The Sommelier had a lyrical narrative for the wines he was serving as well.  All of them truly masters of their craft.\n\nOne might think this dining room would only appeal to older diners, but I saw a diverse mix of young diners in their twenties to older folks- all of whom looked like they were truly enjoying their experience.  The service here made all of us feel special and well cared for.\n\nThere are so many reviews about how excellent the food is, and they are correct.  Every morsel of food was treated masterfully, and nothing was an after-thought.  The pasta, the proteins, the cheeses, the pastries- all amazing and beautifully presented.  They have artists in the kitchen!\n\nThank you for an amazing meal and an amazing experience.More"}

The pairing of Italian wines was inspired. While there are plenty of standouts in the seasonal tasting menu, the fish carpaccio and the ridge pasta with truffle and Marsala were sublime. A definite highlight of San Francisco\u2019s foodie scene.More"}
{"review":"Not our kind of restaurant.  Too quite and large tables so we felt like we had to talk loud to chat.  Music was 1980s muzac and overly saxophonie.  The food was ok.  Service was exceptional.  All in all overpriced for the experience.  Needs to modernize."}
{"review":"The experience was fantastic from beginning to end! Marco , John Paulo gave  is excellent service. And the food was so delicious!"}
{"review":"Picked up a meal kit for 2 last night.  Utterly delicious, and while not cheap, quite a bargain considering the quality of the food (2 Michelin stars are well deserved).  Each dish did very well with reheating.  Nothing was dried out or tired.  Flavors and...balance were perfect across the board.  I very strongly recommend giving it a try.More"}
{"review":"Very disappointed in this restaurant given it\u2019s apparent reputation in the city.  Waited too long for someone to come to the table initially.  Main server was either a robot or Dragon Lady; militaristic and very cold.\n\nThe parm cheese tower with foam was quite good...but overpowered by truffle salt.\n\nRisotto was ok but the meat in the middle was like a hockey puck.  Pasta uneventful.  The big disappointment was the mains.  The duck and lamb has absolutely no flavor.  The lamb was overpowered by licorice. \n\nDesserts also lacking flavor.\n\nThe owner was there and we asked him if he was the owner.  He said yes and walked off.\n\nAn interesting observation-the flower arrangements were well past their time, many of the blooms has already been picked.  Financial issues?\n\nHospitality, food and service; the three components of restaurants, all lacking.More"}
{"review":"Using SOP foodie scale 0 to 5 rating\n\nAmbience = 4, compelling decor with beautiful plates and presentations\n\nService = 1.5, militaristic, cold and irregular service. Think greasy spoon truck stop lunch counter. Owner oddly robotic. Request for kitchen tour deflected and ignored.\n\nCuisine =...2, very nice presentations, off putting odors beyond aggressive sauces, very low flavor in lamb and duck entrees and excessive salt on several course (read excessive). Desserts were the best course.\n\nWine = 4, amazing wine list and knowledgeable wine steward. No hard liquor license thus no bar, could not make a French 75.\n\nVery poor food value and profoundly disappointing. Eat somewhere else.More"}
{"review":"I'm pretty picky for giving 5 stars to a restaurant unless I truly have a unique experience and Acquerello is one of the best restaurant in the Bay Area.\nHigh quality service and amazing food."}
{"review":"We dined here to celebrate my birthday on a trip to SF. We chose Acquerello because we wanted to try a Michelin starred restaurant on our trip. We were not disappointed! Our greeting was warm and friendly. We were shown to our table and offered...black napkins. Water choices were shared and soon we had a lovely amuse bouche or two while we perused the menu. The food is Italian with a modern twist. There is the option of the Chef\u2019s surprise menu, which on this night featured truffles. The second option is your choice of three, four or five course prix fixe menus. We chose the three course and found it to be plenty of food. The wine list is extensive and specializes in our favorite, Italian wines. The highlight for us was talking with the very knowledgeable Sommelier and appreciated the information he shared with us. He made perfect recommendations to go with our food and even gave us a sip before pouring to make sure we liked it. Extra points for feigning interest is our many Italian wine stories! : )\n\nThe service is very professional but also warm and friendly. The breads were tasty as was the house made butter with lava salt. Desserts were incredible as was the strawberry, lemony meringue birthday treat!\n\nOverall Acquerello was everything we had hoped for in this lovely restaurant.More"}
{"review":"Good and service were very good we had a lovely window table. They were very nice about the requests our daughter made for our 7 year old granddaughter.  My husband and I. shared the escargot, a salad, and the duck. We were very pleased with...our selectionsMore"}
{"review":"A perfectly lovely SF iconic spot.  Consistent food and the server who was a bit slow at the start was very engaging and attentive.  The bar area is certainly most entertaining."}
{"review":"I think this is the first time in my life that we left a restaurant hungry! My boyfriend got the octopus, and it was served to him while I was talking to our friends, then I turned my head to see his plate.  \"You already...ate your dinner?\" I asked.  \"We haven't been served yet!\"  He said \"This is my dinner!\"  He was stunned.  It looked like the amount you might leave on your plate when you're done.  My bowl of pasta was seriously about five noodles in the middle of a very large bowl of sauce.  It took me two minutes to eat dinner.  We asked for bread to sop up this enormous bowl of sauce (which is not how pasta should be served) and we were told it would be $3 each.  My boyfriend stopped at Burger King on the way home.  When you're paying $30 to $40 per plate, you should at least get satiated.  Never again!More"}

{"review":"Restaurant was fairly empty but sat at the bar anyway. The menu was decent for lunch but decided to have dessert for lunch instead. The desserts were so good we had two. Would definitely go back for more."}
{"review":"This is a rather unique place.  You need to read up on how absinthe is to be imbibed properly, with the little sugar cube and absinthe fountain.  The main courses are excellent, especially the sole.  They should consider serving dover sole rather than petrale.  The...oysters are superb.  The pot de chocolat is really wonderful.  Walter the waiter is very knowledgeable on the entire menu.  The ambiance:  romantic.  It is pretty pricey.  A very special place.More"}
{"review":"After the matinee performance, we decided to return to Absinthe for an early dinner. This time the gentleman that greeted us  upon arrival was completely different. He was extremely accommodating and gave us a wonderful table off the bar area in the corner. The restaurant...was empty when we arrived but filled up quickly once the theater crowd let out. Loved the frisee au lardon with duck this time had more lardons in the salad. We then ordered and split the petrale entr\u00e9e which was so delicious. The fish was cooked to perfection and was plated beautifully. We ended the meal with a wonderful glass of Limoncello. Nice experience this time and will return!More"}
{"review":"We went there mainly for the drinks. We'd had a big lunch that day and had only soup and salad for dinner. The French onion soup is amazing, and so much more filling than it looks like it will be. The salads are also very...generous in size. The stars are the drinks. We tried absinthe, of course, and had a variety of other creative cocktails. Our bill was very high, but that was because 75% of it came from drinks. The atmosphere is very nice and service was good. California had just lifted its mask mandate when we were there, but this was the only restaurant that asked for proof of vaccination to sit indoors. We didn't mind that at all.More"}
{"review":"We typically visit Absinthe during the ballet season and it is a very nice place to dine before or after the ballet.  Since this was a matinee performance we tried to get a reservation for 5pm and was unable to get one until 6pm so...we chose the 6pm slot.  We thought we would try to 5pm since the restaurant was pretty empty.   They were able to seat us in the rear of the bar area at a table for two next to some loud and rowdy patrons.  We asked for the table next to us which was in the corner and the hostess said \u201cI need to check because everyone is requesting that table\u201d.  Mind you, there was nobody sitting in that area the entire time we dined!!\n\nAnyway, the food is still good \u2013 we ordered the bread ($6 I\u2019d skip this next time as the bread was not very good), onion soup ($14) and their version of frisee au lardon ($19) but instead of lardons they have duck confit.  Both were excellent choices and very filling.  We ordered a bottle of wine and asked for the wine list.  The sommelier said he was in the process of updating the wine list and the only choices he had were on the back of the menu.  We said there was a Gruner Veltliner and he stated that if we liked the Gruner, he would recommend a substitute and he was right.  (They should put more effort in updating the list)  Our server was great \u2013 kept on top of things and made sure we were taken care of.\n\nAll in all, the food is still very good and the atmosphere great after or before a performance but good luck in getting a reservation!More"}
{"review":"Ambiance lovely, service excellent and professional, but every \u201csavory\u201d course was sweet, and they tried to salt the sweet ones. Onion soup tinged with sugar, steak tartare sweetened so much I could not taste the umami of the meat. The pot de creme was supposed...to come with salt on it, but we nixed that and it actually tasted great. \n\nGood wine selections and caviar (which came in a jar and was not sprinkled with sugar) plus the excellent service, ramped this up from one star. \n\nSavory dishes should be\u2014um, savory. I don\u2019t know what this is, but it is not French food, which I have eaten often. It\u2019s as if the chef gave in to Americans\u2019 penchant for sugar and just sprinkled it on everything. Will not return.More"}
{"review":"Walked in without a reservation for a late brunch on Sunday afternoon after the Van Gogh Immersive Experience.  I felt like I was transported to Paris, minus everyone speaking English.  The food was superb: steak tartare was the best I've ever had, the French Onion...soup was filling enough to be a main course after sharing the tartare.   The quiche was also very tasty, though somewhat overshadowed by the wonderful Brussel sprout slaw that came with it.  Swoon unit cocktail had just enough bitterness to cut through the soup.  I will definitely return!More"}
{"review":"Absinthe is in a great location for dining before the Symphony or SF Jazz. Waitstaff is friendly, knowledgeable, attentive and will note your performance time  in order to move you out the door on schedule. Try these fun Cocktails: the Ginger Rogers, Pretty in Pink...and the Non-Alcoholic Absinthe Lemonade. \nStarters: French Onion Soup is hot, rich and with generous amount of Gruyere' cheese over the floating crouton. Caesar Salad has a wonderfully thick, classic Caesar Dressing, lots of Parmesan and large enough to easily share.  \nEntre's: Roasted Chicken and Niman Ranch Cheeseburger are beautifully prepared but again can be shared so you don't worry about doggie bags at a performance.More"}
{"review":"The menu contains classic French dishes like steak tartar and oysters, and healthy options like salmon and vegetarian dishes. The restaurant is willing to accommodate food allergies and has gluten free items on the menu. Good food, good service."}
{"review":"My husband and I visited Absinthe during our stop in San Francisco while exploring the West Coast. We were looking forward to relaxing and enjoying a meal after 10 days of hiking, and Absinthe provided an enjoyable experience.\n\nWe started our meal with a steak...tartare. It was a bit heavy on the oil for me but my husband really enjoyed it. I had a seasonal soup with tomatoes that was very good as well. For dinner, we both had steaks, which were cooked properly and served with delicious mashed potatoes and vegetables. We also shared a side of baked macaroni and cheese, which was good. We finished our meal by sharing the Chocolate de Creme, which was excellent - not too rich but sweet enough to finish the meal. \n\nThe price was about what you'd expect for fine dining. The service was ok. The atmosphere was lovely and romantic. It's a great option for a date night!More"}

{"review":"Our first meal on our first visit to San Francisco and we brunched at Plow\u2026absolutely loved it! Our order: The Plow, the 2 egg brekkie and a glass of Orange juice. The pork sausage patties and the Plow potatoes are the stars of the show....The quality of ingredients just shines through. Lovely customer service and I can\u2019t recommend this place highly enough. Two thumbs up!More"}
{"review":"The food is great and simple but the staff and atmosphere is snobby. They are not interested in the comfort of clients and their needs to enjoy a heated restaurant while paying for a meal indoors."}
{"review":"Breakfast in the plow is what you need. I found this place on envibe and decided to visit this spot. I ordered fried egg sandwich and buttermilk biscuit. SO delicious!"}
{"review":"Fantastic service, simple and cute space, solid brunch. I had the soft scramble but skipped the toast and ordered a biscuit. The highlights of the meal were definitely the potatoes, the biscuit, and the flavored butter that came with the biscuit. Good mimosa, too, and...I appreciated that they have decaf coffee. Food came out quickly and wait staff was attentive. Great for a quick weekday brunch.More"}
{"review":"The food and service was good but prepare to wait for a long time. We came at 8:15 AM and waited for an hour. The one\u2019s after us was told to wait for 1-1:30 hours. But this was on a Sunday morning maybe it\u2019s better...on a weekday. Good luck!More"}
{"review":"Went to Plow on a Friday morning around 9:30am, it took us about 10-12 minutes to get there from downtown. There were about 4 or 5 sets of people in front of us and we were seated in about 30 minutes or so. It\u2019s not...a bad wait as it\u2019s on a fairly quiet corner so you can spread out and there are a few seats as well. \n\nWe were seated outside so I really have no clue what the restaurant looks like. Once we were seated our drink orders were taken quickly and they arrived shortly after. We ordered our food soon after and it arrived about 15 minutes or so later. The food was very good. I had the spinach mushroom scramble with breakfast potatoes and the Hong Kong toast on the side. It was all very flavorful and hearty. I think the sauce on the toast was chilled which cooled the toast a bit but it was still really good. \n\nI quite enjoyed this meal and recommend a visit.More"}
{"review":"Great ambiance and service!  Lovely food! We had the French toast cooked perfectly and a marvelous prosciutto\/Gouda cheese. Definitely  the best breakfast we had in the city, worth the stop!"}

We enjoyed our breakfast so much that we drove from Half Moon Bay the very next day just to have that same great breakfast again!

{"review":"Busy little place with open kitchen , we sat at the bar watching our lunch being prepared with fresh wholesome natural ingredients and our order when arrived with a smile was delicious"}
{"review":"We never tire of this place.  Despite the long wait (30-45 minutes) for brunch, we never miss visiting whenever we come to San Francisco.  \n\nA testament to this place's popularity is when we ate there last.  it was a very cold morning in the very...low 10's and there was a big crowd waiting for a table.  Those who opted to be seated outside were even given blankets to keep them warm. \n\nWe waited for 45 minutes but it was worth it.  The food was excellent as usual.  I had chorizo and egg dish while my wife had pancakes.  We cleaned up our plates!\n\nWell, till our next visit.More"}
{"review":"Unfortunately, TripAdvisor doesn\u2019t allow to give this place zero stars. It\u2019s not one thing, it\u2019s an accumulation of things that made our brunch a bad experience. So, it\u2019s not that there\u2019s a long wait, it\u2019s the arrogance of the hostess who processes diners instead of...making them feel welcome, explicitly saying that there\u2019s nothing they can do if dozens of people line up outside the restaurant. We asked for a cup of coffee while we waited, and they pointed us to a caf\u00e9 two blocks away. The management seems to go out of its way to make things inconvenient. A \u201cwait in line\u201d system with no reservations knowing that demand will result in two-hour waits is disrespectful for diners, and poor self awareness that their current system is inadequate for a place with this level of hype. Might be good for profits, but it\u2019s one sided and abusive. Then there was the food: fried eggs and house fries were extremely salty, bacon was swimming in grease. The side salad and accompanying bread to the scrambled eggs were delicious, but weigh that with a long wait with an attitude and a portion of the meal being salty and greasy and you have a bad trade off. The entitlement of management is evident. But as long as we\u2019re willing to tolerate two-hour lines for something, there will continue to be people subjecting us to it. So, as you read this while waiting for a table, please go someplace else \u2014 the hostess can recommend a caf\u00e9 two blocks away...More"}

{"review":"Loved this casual neighbourhood brunch place, well worth the uber out of the city! Great service, produce and plow plate was DELICIOUS!"}
{"review":"Even though we stopped at 10:45 on a Thursday morning, Plow was busy. The staff is friendly and efficient so a table was quickly available. My wife loved her lemon ricotta pancake and home fries. My gazpacho surprised me when it arrived and looked like...tomato soup. It had all the flavors that I expected and was very good. I asked for a hunk of bread to go with it, and the waitress served me a side of toast with homemade apricot jam. That was perfectly done, but not what I was expecting. Everyone there was enjoying whatever they were eating. The menu had many fun options, all which looked delicious.More"}

{"review":"After a tiring day of sightseeing we happened upon this restaurant. Although the menu was quite brief, the options were varied. My son had the fried chicken and \"the best mash he'd ever had\". I had the Rueben and our friend the roasted cauliflower and...both were delicious. Our waiter, Jeff, could not have been more accommodating. The best meal of our trip to California!More"}
{"review":"Great place. Bartender was very friendly. Near the ferry building. Would love to go again and try the other recommendations but the steak was great."}
{"review":"I have been here before the pandemic but don't recall exactly what I had then for lunch.  But I didn't recall the menu being the same as it is now for lunch.  It seems it has a Jewish Deli type of theme and mostly sandwiches....I had the 12 hour brisket sandwich which was in the section of \"big sandwiches\".  I was thinking NY Deli style \"big\".  But I was a little disappointed when it was served.  At $20  (without any side) it was acceptable but by no means \"big\"!!  Also my friend ordered the same thing, and hers looked like it had twice as much meat in it as mine.  I didn't say anything to her or to the waiter, maybe I should have.  It definitely is a quality issue.  I have no photo proof either, as I usually take photos of my food, but I was not moved or impressed in any way to think it \"photo worthy\".  The meat was very good tasting, though, so I'll give it that!More"}
{"review":"I took a large group here and had a private room. We had drinks and passed Hors D before sitting down to a buffet style dinner. The food was excellent (the carved beef was anither level) - but it was the service lead by Kinga...which made the evening. Big thanksMore"}

{"review":"My spouse and I come here every Restaurant Week, and this year we made One Market our first stop.  The ambience is always quite elegant but not stuffy.  The service is very attentive and professional.  \n\nOnly one of us had the special menu, primarily because...there was only one starter and one main, unlike in previous years.  I hope they go back to offering a choice in the future.  The salad was very fresh and had an excellent dressing.  The asparagus and bacon were delicious.  The flounder main course was very sweet and fresh; it was cooked perfectly, and the accompanying vegetables were quite good.  The burger and potato salad from the regular lunch menu were also great!  The medium rare patty was really juicy and thick, and the large portion of pimiento cheese complimented it.   The butterscotch pudding dessert was a very nice ending to the meal.  Overall, we were definitely pleased with the quality of our meal at One Market.More"}
{"review":"Staying close to One Market and passing by all the time. We decided to go to the Friday Prime Rib night. \n\nOne Market restaurant has very elegant deco and atmosphere is great. The smoked Prime rib is super tender and juice, melted into your mouse....We also had octopus as starter, very tasty as well. Overall experience was great.. definably will be back for more!More"}
{"review":"The bartender, Jose, was the BEST.  The fried chicken was to die for? The service was great, however patrons using their cell phones and talking loudly at the bar should be eliminated."}
{"review":"We have been to One Market many times for Happy Hour after work but never for dinner.   They are located across the Ferry Building on the corner which is a beautiful location.  The restaurant is very large and has a beautiful setting whether it be...a chef\u2019s table, dining room or a private dining room.   We recently dined there for a birthday celebration and had a wonderful experience.  \n\nWith the encouragement of our server, we started with the special cucumber salad which was delicious.  We then had:\n-\t  Pork entr\u00e9e \u2013 perfectly cooked and delicious\n-\tSmoked Prime Rib \u2013 Not sure if I like my Prime Rib smoked as the smoke overpowers the taste of the meat.  It is served with spinach, mashed potatoes and Yorkshire pudding.   All of these were amazingly delicious even with the smoked Prime Rib\n-\tOrchiette pasta \u2013 simple yet very delicious  \n\nSince it was my birthday celebration, they sent a large celebration dessert (at no charge) to the table and we just devoured it.\n\nIf you are looking to celebrate a special occasion or just have a wonderful pampered meal with great food, give this place a try!  We love sitting at a chef's table to watch the preparation of the meal - will request that next time.More"}
{"review":"I held a family celebration for 12 at One Market, my third visit to the restaurant in as many visits to the city.   We had cocktails with set treats, but an open menu and wine list.    The service could not have been better and the...food received praise from all in attendance.More"}
{"review":"I've eaten at One Market a few times and make it a point to lunch there during every Restaurant Week.  Thus my spouse and I made sure to dine there again during this most recent Restaurant Week.  It was yet another truly excellent meal. (I've...never had one there that wasn't!)  First of all, it's a beautiful space, with a panoramic view that includes glimpses of the bay.  The decor is as elegant and fresh as when the restaurant opened a quarter of a century ago.  It was totally full and the clientele included a celebrity former SF mayor.  Service is ultra-professional and impeccably courteous.  \n\nNow for the food.  We had all four dishes offered, both appetizers and both mains.  The squash soup was very good, but the salad was better with its poached pears, blue cheese, and marcona almonds.  After these starters came two excellent mains, branzino and a pork chop.  The former was exceptional, crisp skinned and scrupulously fresh, but the latter was simply perfect.  Dessert was an ice cream puff, with matcha ice cream and chocolate sauce - superb!  I can't think of even a small criticism of my experience at One Market and give it an enthusiastic thumbs up.More"}

{"review":"My husband & I went on Friday night and were looking forward to a great dinner. Right from the beginning things seemed odd, the dining room tables and chair placement made it look like they had pushed most tables outward toward the banquette and a...huge table in the middle with small tables circled around. All the tables around the banquette seating area were so tight, but the area between the large center table could have easily had two tops seated comfortably. The decor and vibe of the space felt like there had not been any thought put into it, and\/or very much on the cheap. And then there was our waiter, wow he was clearly not happy to be  working and was poorly trained in hospitality.  We started with the little gems with green goddess dressing where the dressing was slopped over & so thick we had heaps alongside the plate. The burger, that we use to love, was served rare in the middle even though we asked for well done. Worse yet, the cheese on top was cold to the touch and was like Kraft American cheese slices, certainly not cheddar.  The onions were not carmelized, rather raw onions diced and piled high.  I could go on and on regarding the fails from the kitchen. My husband and I were seated very closely to a table of four finishing their meal. They quietly asked if we had been here previously to Covid shutdown. We told them we have eaten at Park Tavern several times prior to Covid and too many times to  count in the Moose's era. They too had dined previously, but first time back since Covid. We chatted briefly about how flummoxed our experience was. It was the worst higher end dining we could recall. It was clear throughout the dining room that many patrons were literally baffled by how bizarre & terrible it was.  I would never recommend to anyone unless EVERY aspect was changed by new management. It is NOT like it use to be! It's pretty sad, actually!More"}
{"review":"Located in the Italian neighborhood of North Beach, Park Tavern is the sister restaurant to Marlowe, which I had previously visited and enjoyed immensely, so I had high hopes. I was certainly not let down!  Our table was not ready for our reservation time, so...we started with classy cocktail at the bar, and no sooner did we take a first sip and our table was ready, so we move into the dining room. Excellent handling and speedy service in a unexpected situation.\n\nOur table was right next to the bay of windows at the front of the restaurant, we enjoyed the lingering sun and cool breeze from outside while working our way through the amazing menu: first, tasty treats like Wagyu beef jerky and brussels sprout chips, a house specialty and all too delicious - I had tried them at Marlowe and fell in love! Tasting every component of every course like we are judging some classy food contest, we continue with a take on fried green tomatoes, and a Kobe beef tartare served with a deconstructed ceasar salad. I was particularly impressed with a garnish of pickled caper berry leaves. The ingredients and re-imagining of dishes here is exemplary.\n\nThe mains are no less impressive - my pan-seared salmon, with its dusting of fleur de sel, is probably the best salmon I have ever eaten. And dessert! Oh my, the dark chocolate torte is divine, the cr\u00e8me brul\u00e9e lusciously-creamy, and the light-as-air chocolate chiffon birthday cake comes complete with a lit birthday candle! \n\nDon't miss out on a chance to try Park Tavern - it is the best high-class restaurant around, without all of the pomp and pageantry. It just feels comfortable.More"}
{"review":"We were here for a wedding reception and it was an amazing venue. The dining room, itself was vintage boho glam (in my opinion). Loved how the light played off the beautiful wallpaper. The menu the bride and groom chose was so unique and delicious....We especially loved the deviled eggs (wow!) and the roasted Brussel sprouts. The risotto, steak, and salmon were perfect. The desserts were SO GOOD. Moist and tasty.\nThe staff were friendly, efficient, and capable.\nWe thoroughly enjoyed it.More"}
{"review":"Went to this place with a group of friends while visiting San Francisco. The deviled eggs were THE BEST! Our server was awesome and made great menu recommendations. Everything was fast and tasted so good! Even saved room for the Birthday Cake Dessert!!"}
{"review":"Great service, and no attitude for not ordering alcoholic beverages.  The brunch menu is decent, and there seems to be something for everyone.  It was my first avocado toast experience, and it was a perfect starter - not too filling, and very tasty.  The avocado...was fresh and ripe, and it was sliced neatly across the top of fresh, just fluffy enough focaccia.  Delicious! I'm converted and will be looking for the dish everywhere.  I ordered Shrimp and Grits for my main brunch dish, and loved every bite.  The shrimp were big and plump, fresh, and prepared without the heads (thankfully).  The grits portion was a well prepared polenta (not too gritty or dry or mushy).  The dish was nicely arranged, and there was a spicy red sauce that added just the right amount of heat.  \nPark Tavern offers sidewalk seating, but I opted to dine indoors.  The room is large and airy, with dark wood accents, and just enough space to move around freely without bumping into other diners.  Acoustics were just fine - not too noisy, but definitely lively.  I'll go back to Park Tavern next time I visit SF and try dinner.More"}
{"review":"I live on the other end of town and always like to venture into other neighborhoods to discover new places to dine. I had read some information that this place was named best new restaurant on 2012 and that it was part of the \"Big...Night\" restaurant group - for those in the know - that includes other locations such as Marlowe and the Cavalier (one of my favorite pre-theater locations). \n\nI visited with a friend and we arrived early to grab a drink at the bar. It was a relatively busy Friday night, but not too crowded. We grabbed some stools and I ordered a McClaren gin cocktail and my friend went with a glass of Malbec. \n\nLater we checked in with the front desk and were seated at a two-top in the front section of the restaurant. It was a little noisy - for some reason Elvis was playing over the speakers. Our table was super wobbly and our server fixed it perfectly within minutes. \n\nFor food, we each order a deviled egg (so good, with bacon and a bit of a pepper kick). Then we shared the warm goat cheese salad - which was perfect. For a main course, I went with the short ribs and my friend ordered the steak frites. Both were spot on. We finished by sharing the ice cream sandwiches - vanilla ice cream with blueberries. This was an off point because it was delivered to our table, but we had no utensils - and the blueberries were meant to be dolloped on top. So we had to grab a passing person who brought back two forks. It would have been helpful to have some knifes as well, in order to neatly scoop the scattered berries. \n\nWe also enjoyed a few glasses of Mablec during the meal (should've gone for the bottle). \n\nAll in all, a good experience. I'd definitely recommend this place. It's a bit pricey, but the food was delicious.More"}

{"review":"I didn\u2019t book a table and clearly should have done on a busy Thursday evening (Mea Culpa). The hostess predicted a 30-40 min wait and having popped down the road for a beer returned to eat.\nSeated quickly and provided menus\/wine list, but took 15+...mins before anyone returned to take a drink order.\nMeals were good quality\/ quantity, but... the background music is such that the volume of chat increases to be heard above it and the overall ambient volume makes conversation across a table very difficult. \nThe addition of taxes at the end, allied to a tip, will see the total ~36% higher than the menu list price. Not at all unique to this establishment, but it did mean that 2 glasses of wine, 2 mains and 1 side came to $160, and when all is considered, I\u2019ve had better meals for $160.More"}

Quite noisy even for a 3\/4 empty place on a Monday night - had to keep asking friends to repeat what they said...even though we were in the dining area away from the bar.  Not a great spot to take a date.More"}
{"review":"I have never left a restaurant before without having eaten the dinner we ordered. Last Sunday I did. I have never provided a one star rating before. Today I will. This was singularly the worst dining experience I have ever had. The service in this...place is horrible. We sat for over 90 minutes with no food being brought to us, inquiring a number of times about the status of our dinner. The waiter said consistently, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, just a few more minutes.\u201d Then the manager, \u201cWe\u2019ll have your food right out.\u201d After an hour and a half, we checked in one last time getting a similar response. We informed the manager we were leaving. Perhaps they were having an off night, but I\u2019ll never know. With the abundance of outstanding restaurants in the area, I\u2019ll likely just go to another establishment.More"}

{"review":"This was my first time to 21st Amendment. The food was ok, not great. I had the Chicken Diablo sandwich and my husband had the Mexican Burger. Despite the name, my sandwich was bland. There were lots of saut\u00e9ed onions which were good and a...lot of melted cheese. I added ketchup and Tapatio sauce for flavor. The ordering app is terrible. I didn't know that my sandwich came with fries. There was no mention on the app. My husband said the beef on his burger was tasty. Although he ordered it medium and it was medium rare. An $18 burger is pricey. It doesn't come with fries. In the app you can add fries for $4 more. Since we thought neither of our meals came with fries, we ordered some but we wouldn't have if we had known that mine did. Also there was a notification when I tried to ordrr the beer that I wanted. It said they were low on quantity and I wasn't able to order it. The notification should have said it wasn't available. Running low and out aren't the same thing.More"}

{"review":"My wife and I have visited here before, 5 years ago. The neighborhood has changed for the better and the outside seating is either out front on the sidewalk, or in the area  around the corner from the entrance with several covered tables. \n\nThe ordering...process is outside around the corner.  I took pictures of the menu (no convenient QR code) and we settled on the food and drinks. We moved tables to escape a noisy group. Since there isn\u2019t wait staff seating you or assigned to particular tables, this makes table hopping wa-ay easier. \n\nThe food is regular bar fare and well prepared.  However I come here because of their beer selection. It didn\u2019t disappoint.  I recommend a visit to taste what they don\u2019t distribute nationally.More"}
{"review":"It has been a LONG time since I've been here, maybe a year and a half, and it was a most pleasant reunion! Several of us came for lunch and left happy and pigged out, and we remembered why we love coming here!\n\nThe place...is still the same, with bar seating, tables, booths and an upper dining area, all of which surge for lunch about 12noon and ebb about 1:30pm, so plan accordingly. We got here about 11:40, shortly after the 11:30 opening and the bar area was already busy, and tables were starting to fill. \n\nWe were seated by the host and presented menus by our server, Aili, \nand we set about the most important decision for the meal - which beer to try! We settled on a couple of \"The Pink and The Green,\" a nice lighter IPA with watermelon, cucumber and Hibiscus, a neat trio of tastes that is refreshing, and at 7% alcohol, rather moderate. I tried the \"Invasion of the Barley Snatchers Barrel Aged Barley Wine.\" A mouthful indeed, and at 11.5% alcohol, and 65 IBUs it is quite a mouthful of taste as well! Very dark, and bitter like I like it, and a perfect small glass - good considering the kick it can have for you. \n\nMoving on to food, we ordered a couple of the Sully's cheese curds, a couple of the Wilson's Wicked Wings, an order of the Totchos and a Brewmaster's Fish and Chips. The food came rather quickly and was just as we remembered. The cheese curds are very good here (among the best I have found anywhere) with just a little grease left on the plate, not too much, but enough to notice - still, very good taste, especially with the chipotle ranch dip (marinara not my favorite with the cheese curds). The wings were drenched in sauces and literally finger licking good - you'll need BOTH moist towelettes that are provided! \n\nThe Totchos were a hit as well, always a favorite. With the bacon on the side, they are tater tots topped with red onion, tomatoes, cheddar cheese, pepper jack cheese, pico de gallo salsa, fresh cilantro and cilantro sour cream. Oh so good. \n\nAnd the fish and chips were delicious, too, with the fish lightly battered and not too greasy! Very nice with tartar sauce or vinegar. The fries were hot and crispy as well. \n\nThe meal was delightful, and the service was excellent, with water and iced teas kept topped off, and dishes cleared quickly (thanks Aili!). If you're in the area and craving a good beer or just good bar food, this is a great place to kill that craving - give them a try!More"}

I had the Nitro Hazer and the Monk's Blood.  Both were delicious.  For dinner we had the Chinese Chicken Salad and the Verde Burger.  Both were good portions and tasted awesome.

There was also an interesting salad with sliced almonds snd sliced nectarines on mixed greens. \n But I am fairly certain that the surly young man who waited on us...was a busboy, not a waiter.

There was no utensils, no napkins, no bread. The order came to almost 90 bucks. We tip well because of this time, I called the waiter and asked what they could be thinking as he knew we were in a hotel. We had to bring it back and they did refund us but the Manager gave my husband a hard time and said she didn\u2019t appreciate me calling the waiter. We were very disappointed with the staff and how they treat customers and how poorly the meal was put together. There are other choices in town. Try taste of Roma or Spinnakers, at a time like this it didn\u2019t make sense to us for a restaurant to not care as the manger expressed to us.

Halibut to me at $36 was pricey for the presentation- served on a non-decorous mound  of mashed potato- and did not meet my hoped...for enjoyment level. Deserts were a disappointment.  The banana tart was not a tart- bananas arranged on a flat round circle-no sides- of some unpleasant non-tart dough. The circle was surrounded by pull-your fillings out sticky, hard, peanut brittle like pieces.  I would not order it again.

{"review":"The dinner was an artistic presentation that intellectually challenged ones' sensory understanding of food.  Chef Crenn's techniques decomposed common ingredients and then reconstituted them artistically to create new flavors and texture.   The food was extremely delicate and required a lot of concentration to appreciate.  The...meal reminded me of the wholesome California spirit of Chez Panisse in the 1970's, the sophistication and precision of Jamin in the 1980's, and the creativeness of Ferran Adria in the 2000's.   A thoroughly enjoyable dinner. \n\nFor wine, we had a 4 year old Corton Charlemagne from a vintage that is early maturing.  The wine tased like butter scotch in the first 45 minutes, evolved to pineapple cream in the next 45 minutes, but then shut down for the remaining meal.  Perhaps it needed 5 or 10 more years of aging.More"}
{"review":"An absolutely amazing meal. Both the presentation and the food were exceptional and the service was wonderful - so beautifully choreographed. It's a tasting menu and yes, the bite sizes are small, but we did not leave hungry - nor were we stuffed - it...really was the right amount of food spread out over 2 hours. It's a very small space with just eight tables, which explains why it's so hard to get a reservation. We didn't do the wine pairings instead opting to have full bottles of wine. The wine prices however, we more than a little exhobanant but the wines were delicious. An incredible experience and would recommend for anyone who appreciates food as an art.More"}
{"review":"Creative, elaborately presented courses. Some tasty, some muted. But at the end of the meal we were still hungry. Portions ridiculously small. Needed extra bread after bread course. Dinner is an elaborate show with a bevy of servers, somewhat disorienting. One server per table preferable....Coordinated wine flights excellent. But amazingly, we were charged for coffee. I wanted to support Chef Crenn, and glad to have had the experience but will not repeat. And, such a hassle to get bookings.More"}

{"review":"Atelier Crenn\n\nAfter trying at least 3 different times, including a wait list, wife and I obtained a reservation for a midweek evening.    The restaurant accepts only pre-paid ($410 per person with add-ons for chef\u2019s tasting menu, no other choice. Service included.) reservations with wine,...supplements, etc. paid at end of meal. From the outset, the staff (perhaps as many as patrons) were welcoming, warm, and always attentive.  The layout is supposed to resemble at atelier with a central open space, some paintings, and a number of nooks, with framed poems on walls. There was also a sheet of poem on each table, a pretty long poem that took a while to read if you were so inclined.  The atmosphere was somewhat dignified and conducive until more patrons arrived and all talked and laughed loudly \u2013 then it became quite loud which was annoying for us sedate diners.  The 14+ course dinner (without wine pairing, but with a glass of champagne each, a half bottle of white wine, and a supplemental caviar course) was overall delicious including some unexpected delights, like the first course \u2013 an icy cold ball that burst in the mouth.  For a Pescatarian restaurant, however, we were much of the time unable to taste the pesces in the food.  Each dish was visually attractive, artfully prepared, intricately constructed (or deconstructed), many to be eaten in one bite. The teeny bites, however, were largely, very tasty.  There were several dishes, e.g. the deconstructed onion soup, black cod, that were identifiable, not teeny, and excellent.  The \u201cmoving feast\u201d involved our moving, after the main course, to the Bar Crenn next door for the dessert and after dinner drinks following a brief tour through the kitchens.  Bar Crenn had the look of a 1920\u2019s comfortable bar.  Overall, this atelier presents visually beautiful petite dishes, with very good to excellent taste and outstanding attentive service.  The final bill came to $1,200 of which $820 was prepaid at reservation.  Dining in this exclusive 3 starred Michelin restaurant, with its memorable service, savoring the artful yet uneven palate pleasers, was an experience!More"}
{"review":"Not that Atelier Crenn needs any more reviews, but this is a very unique dining experience. We booked months in advance, and we weren't disappointed. The entire evening was a story told in 18 chapters of awe-inspiring dishes. We celebrated out daughter's 21st birthday there,...and they made it fun. It is an incredibly sensory experience while you are waited on lavishly by the entire team. Some of the reviews here say it's expensive. Yes, it is. It's a Michelin 3-star restaurant. Don't go if it doesn't fit your budget. But you will never have a dining experience like this. Watch the Netflix Chef's Table episode on Dominique Crenn before you go. If you can get in here, you won't be disappointed.More"}
{"review":"I was visiting friends for a week of gastronomy delights and we were told to try this restaurant, but we were so disappointed! Although the food was  presented beautifully, there was nothing extraordinary or memorable about and not one of us enjoyed any dish on...the tasting menu. We also upgraded and added truffles to some of our dishes and even that didn't uplift the flavour. In addition, we added the wine pairing for an extra $250 per person and only 1 of the wines they paired, were enjoyable for us.\n\nWhat was worse was my friend found a hair on her plate with the second dish and while they did apologise, no compensation of a glass of wine was offered. They didn't even appear embarrassed! If you are paying $395 per person and in a 3 Michelin star restaurant, you do not expect to find a hair in your food! Yes, mistakes happen but the restaurant did not even care or make up for it with a proper apology or a gesture of compensation, by a drink or something!\n\nAlthough the staff were friendly, service was also slow. The atmosphere was also lacking and very pretentious. I can no stand places that give the feeling that their establishment is better than their patrons and their reaction to the hair on the plate compounded it! We were so disappointed.\n\nTwo days later, we found ourselves in Napa and at the French Laundry, which was absolutely amazing and restored my faith in what a real, 3 Michelin star restaurant is all about!\n\nSkip it and save your money.More"}
{"review":"I\u2019ve dined all over the world and at dozens of Michelin-starred restaurants and Atelier Crenn is easily one of my top 5 dining-foodie experiences ever! The chefs\u2019 and staff\u2019s passion for excellence is abundantly obvious from the amuse bouche through the last bite of chocolate....I was a bit leery of on a non-meat dinner service but was blown away by the creative, innovative, fresh and extremely tasty fish and vegetable dishes. I highly recommend you request the wine pairing with the dinner since the synergy between them elevated both. The dishes were artfully presented by a courteous and professional staff who took pride in their work and the food prepared for us. It was a pleasure to meet the executive chef, sous chefs, and pastry chef when we transitioned from the dinner service at Atelier Crenn to the dessert service at Bar Crenn. It is easy to see why Dominique Crenn\u2019s restaurant in the Cow Hollow district of San Francisco is a 3* Michelin Restaurant and consistently rated in the top 50 restaurants of the world\u2026PERFECTION!!!! If you\u2019re a foodie this restaurant should be at the top of your must do bucket list!More"}
{"review":"Hands down one of the best dining experiences that I have ever had. Many thanx to Chef Crenn for stopping by our table and making us feel so welcome and also to Alex and Ernesto for taking such good care of us. The food was...sublime and I'm still thinking about which course was my favorite. After 14 courses, my mind was blown and it will be hard to stop talking about this dinner. So worth the investment.More"}
{"review":"Our party of 4 had a phenomenal dining experience at Atelier Crenn. The chef and her staff totally understand all elements of restaurant hospitality, starting with the delicious and innovative menu, but extending to the ambiance and professional but incredibly friendly service. We selected the...\u201cmovable feast\u201d tasting menu experience and, after consultation with the Sommelier, the wine pairing (I note that the wine pairing was not at all \u201cpushed\u201d). Every course was beautiful and delicious. We have had the privilege to dine at what are considered some of the best restaurants in the world and Atelier Crenn is right up there with them.More"}
{"review":"Beautiful restaurant with only eight black walnut dining tables where table-side presentations appealed to my visual needs and the food tantalized my mouth and soothed my grumbling belly.   I love that this place caters to all senses; hot, cold, sweet, salt, savory, sour.  Wine pairing...was spot on.  Service was impeccable.  Loved the brioche bread, so yummy!  The \u201corange\u201d dessert was a welcome surprise.More"}
{"review":"Growing up a meat eater in Texas doesn't prepare one for Atelier Crenn but Creen does make you happy you escaped the state for a healthier life in California!  From the very beginning of this experience the existential philosophy of ethical hedonism sustainability is stamped...upon your forehead.  While the food is definitely fine art it is also belly friendly and the portion sizes are most definitely perfectly sized for  long evening.  Some other fine dining locations should take note.  At the close of the meal is the dessert courses which are nothing short of pure genius!  We were laughing at the table over the audacity of the creative team in the kitchen!  Our only critique of the evening would be the disappointment in the wine pairings especially as most of them had a heavy carbon footprint and were out of step with the local sustainability so well executed on the menu.  While there were some of the top Napa and Sonoma names on the greater wine list there was a decidedly lack of incorporation of these great local wines into the sustainable presentations.  An organic producer from Europe just doesn't meet the sustainability ethos.  When I return we will pay corkage or order some great local wines!  The abalone was ridiculous and made me remember the day I met George Moscone and had abalone at the \nWaterfront.  Just a great day to remember!  Finally and most importantly the wait staff was impeccable!  But remember to bring your wallet as this joint isn't cheap!More"}

{"review":"The food is always delicious and the bar is just fun! Try the Creole shrimp and soak up the extra sauce with bread. Great Cubans sandwich."}
{"review":"Excellent food and good service. For a tapas restaurant, you won't find a place that has larger portions. Food quality is good and everything tastes great. Not at all inexpensive, but not overpriced. I recommend the fried calamari, the sauteed mushrooms, and the chicken quesadilla....This is not a typical quesadilla, but essentially a tortilla stuffed with shredded barbecue chicken. I saw other menu items heading out to different tables, and everything looked amazing. I've been coming to Cha Cha Cha for many years. The one on Mission Street closed, so the Haight Street location is all you've got. I definitely recommend it.More"}

{"review":"My husband and i went to ChaChaCha last night expecting a fun latin restaurant with good quality (not fine) food.  We were sorely disappointed.  They must rely on a young\/tourist crowd who have never traveled to Spain, Cuba or any other place where real Spanish...food is served.  \n\n1. Raved about sangria is cheaply made and served without flair.  The fruit was old and soggy and the taste was of strong inexpensive wine and booze of some sort.  \n2.  Empanada was doughy and while they said it was chicken curry, there was mostly some vegetable, very little chicken and very little curry. The black beans on the side were good.  \n3.  Warm spinach salad was over dressed and poorly presented.  looked overtossed and it just did not taste very good.\n4.  The Paella was the final straw....it was filled with inexpensive shrimp, calamari and bay scallops that had been treated and tasted as if they had come out of a frozen bag of seafood from a bulk store. The linguica wasn't much better and i could not tell if the final protien was a white fish or chicken.  \n\nI gave it one star as the flan was passable and the North Point IPA my husband had was  cold and good.  \n\nPlease lower your expectations of this restaurant.  BTW--the wait staff was pretty good, but inattentive and seemed rushed and disinterested.More"}
{"review":"My friend and I just wanted to grab a drink and walked into Cha Cha Cha. After about a minute of checking out the amazing food display on everyone's tables we knew we'd be dining here as well. Hands down one of the best tapas...places I have ever been in the US. \nEverything feels authentic from the wait staff, the decor, the plating, the taste. We wanted to order everything, but our server cut us off after three plates stating that was plenty.  BEST SANGRIA EVER!!\nI highly HIGHLY recommend coming here.More"}

Would be good with pasta too\n\nFried new potatoes with chile pasilla aioli - potatoes didn't have seasoning which I liked because usually seasoned potatoes are too salty. The skin was nice and crispy and the sauce was good\n\nSteamed mussels - nothing specialMore"}

{"review":"One of my biggest fears while traveling is that of the tourist trap. A place where you pay a bunch of money for mediocre food and average at best service. This wasn\u2019t that type of place. \n\nFirst. The view is of course spectacular. Right in...the middle of the marina which is why I thought it might be a tourist trap. \n\nSecond. It\u2019s pricey. But not really any more than any other crabhouse I\u2019ve ever been to. \n\nBut here\u2019s the thing. The food was great - we got oysters and the crab - their potatolitos and a side salad. Nothing particularly stands out as being different - but all tasty and fresh. \n\nBut for me the most important thing is that I don\u2019t go out to eat necessarily to be blown away by a meal. I go out to eat because I want ambiance and service. The view was great. Service was attentive. They cleared plates when we were done so the table wasn\u2019t constantly cluttered. Really pleased overall. Thanks!More"}

{"review":"We booked a table for 8pm and arrived just before that. The host literally looked at us and said \u2018we close at 8\u2019.  We were a little surprised but said we\u2019d booked for 8 and finally a nice lady seated us but said we had...to order straight away as the kitchen was closing. We decided to share a starter and main but we\u2019re told they would arrive together as the kitchen was closing\u2026\u2026 \n\nThe food arrived very quickly (no surprise  there) and was okay bit it\u2019s weird having your starter and main all on the table at the same time. In fact the restaurant itself is lovely but it was so uncomfortable to be eating at 8.30 to have all the surrounding tables loudly cleared of everything. People literally had their last fork of food on their fork heading towards their mouth and the plate was removed and the chairs being loudly stacked next to you wasn\u2019t good.  It was very unwelcoming and frankly, rude. \n\nIf you close early then fine, but don\u2019t take bookings at 8? They need to review their booking system urgently- there were many unhappy people there tonight. \n\nNot a fun night out and not cheap either.More"}

{"review":"I\u2019d been wanting to visit Salitos for a long time. My husband, my mother-in-law and I went last night - it was a Saturday and very busy. The atmosphere was celebratory and the location is obviously wonderful to enjoy a meal. I wouldn\u2019t say the...waiter was overlying friendly but it was a busy evening so I\u2019m sure he had his work cut out. \nIn any case I ordered the Sea Bass, my MIL the Salmon and my husband the Crab Cakes. The bass was nicely cooked and though it lacked seasoning (they provide salt and pepper on the table) I enjoyed it but the cous cous it comes with is lack luster at best and mixed in with sad frozen vegetables. The salmon, same story. Nice fish but lazily served with the same uninspiring cous cous. The crab cakes were tasty and crispy. They come as is with no garnish - and nothing green even - we had to ask for lemon. So I will say that the fish itself is nicely done (not spectacular but good) however what this place lacks is some freshness!\n Going to a seafood restaurant I would expect some fresh herbs and zingy flavours and the food definitely lacks this, hence only the three stars. If you want a decent place in a nice location for sure it\u2019s not a bad one but it\u2019s not cheap and don\u2019t expect to be blown away by the food! We all agreed that we won\u2019t be rushing back any time soon.More"}

This place was recommended by a local for a \"special\" meal, and we weren't disappointed.More"}
{"review":"We shared the famous chicken dish, and really enjoyed it. The service was attentive and moved our appetizers and drinks along at a good pace before our chicken was ready, as it does take an hour. It was a nice atmosphere and very high quality...food.\n\nThis restaurant also has a decent half-bottle wine selection, which was great and not something I see very often as someone whose spouse cannot drink for medical reasons.More"}
{"review":"Finally made a long-anticipated visit to the Zuni Cafe late on a weekday afternoon while passing through San Francisco. The dining rooms are bright and lively, and the servers are nattily attired, but after a warm welcome at the entrance, service was pretty chilly. The...numerous waiters who served our table seemed in a hurry to get us out of there (the restaurant was not busy). We'd had the appetizers -- a plate of olives and fantastic slices of sourdough bread with fresh butter -- for about three minutes when our entrees were pushed onto the table.  The burger was excellent, and a entree Caesar salad was lemony and delicious. Might have lingered for dessert or another glass of wine had the service been a little more gracious.  The bill for our table of two came with a 20 percent service charge already added.More"}
{"review":"Sorry, but the famous chicken was dry and flavorless. I am not joking when I say that the $5 chicken at Costco is significantly better. The waiter was pleasant and a joy. However, the food is highly over rated. We had the shoestring potatoes to...fill the 1 hour wait for the chicken. Because the potatoes are thin, they cool within a couple of minutes. My wife does not drink, so she had a lemonade. I had a glass of wine. No dessert, and the bill was $184. Outrageous for this.More"}
{"review":"We were really looking forward to visiting this restaurant so many people and press had recommended. However not only were we very disappointed with the quality of the food, but we both got sick! We decided to forgo the chicken and got fish and certainly...cannot say that it was good. Major disappointment!More"}
{"review":"Always a pleasure to be here for the last 30+ years. Great food and incredible service. You, along myself, help shape San Francisco ;)"}
{"review":"The fig appetizer was an adventure that unfolded with each bite. The rest (flank steak) was satisfying but not enticing. Fabulous service and exceptional corner window seat. The menu is updated daily and farm oriented which is a standout feature."}
{"review":"Food is good but the waiter lied and said no when we asked if the 25% surcharge was a tip. We left a cash tip too. Will never darken their door again. Not polite to lie to customers. We live in San Francisco and always...like Zuni before they went woke. And now lying waiters. No thank you.More"}
{"review":"We had to come back here for the chicken. It is to die for. We hadn't been in 2 years, so we were very eager to revisit Zuni. Found out when we had cocktails at the bar that Zuni instituted a 25% 'Fair-wage' surcharge. More...on this part later.\nWe ordered appetizer, a side dish, and waited for our chicken (takes about an hour). I ordered a Croze Hermitage, our waiter brought a different Hermitage which I didn't realize. My fault for not catching it. Price difference is significant (he brought out a more expensive one) but I didn't complain since I had acknowledged the bottle when it was shown to me. But throughout dinner we had to stopped bus boys and other servers to ask for our waiter.  During our 2+ hour stay we had to ask for him 4 times. And we kept seeing a team of waiter hanging out in the kitchen. So to be imposed a 25% fair wage surcharge for service??? I would tip more if service warranted that. We wondered if the service staff is now guaranteed that minimum amount, why would they work harder? It was just an unpleasant dining experience. Maybe the ownership should pay higher wages to their staff.More"}

{"review":"We had the famous roast chicken with bread salad for lunch. It did not disappoint, but there is so much of it that it could be better shared with 3 people instead of 2.

Enjoyed the piano and accordion serenade at the Saturday lunch.More"}
{"review":"Very underwhelmed. My friend recommended this cafe so I decided to go there for my last meal for the trip in SF. I ordered a neri spaghetti with clams. The portion was tiny. The taste was alright. Nothing special. The restaurant doesn't serve latte with...any other milk apart from full fat milk. I was quite surprised given this is California. Cancelled it and asked for the bill. The latte was still on the bill. The waiter said he would correct it and he did. The restaurant champions 25% surcharge and calls it fair wage. It basically means they don't pay their waiters enough so you have to tip more. I know 20% is normal in America but 25% by default. Meh...  So all in all a very underwhelming and overpriced meal.More"}

{"review":"Ate here with my family for a first lunch in California. Service was fast and the staff were very nice, which is always appreciated. In addition, the atmosphere was very pleasant, with nice music. The only seating is outside, so while this wasn\u2019t a problem...for us on a nice summer day, if it\u2019s rainy or particularly cold, that would be a problem. Everything was clean as well. As for the food itself, it was pretty decent. I personally very much enjoyed the chicken enchiladas with the tomato sauce, although I didn\u2019t enjoy the way they handled the cheese. Otherwise it was delicious, and while everyone at our table enjoyed the chips, I thought they were especially good. One person in our group ordered the fish and chips, which have the unique twist of being served with actual corn chips instead of French fries. A nice idea, and the chips were good but the fish itself was too oily. The shrimp tacos were\u2026 mixed. The shrimp itself was fantastic, but the onions and green peppers didn\u2019t taste good or pair with the shrimp well. There was also no sauce of any kind. The pork taco, steak taco and fish taco were all tasty, but nothing special. All in all, a nice place to eat with decent prices but nothing I\u2019d be jumping to recommend.More"}

From the cold cervesas to the homemade chips and guacamole to the \u201cBig Donkey\u201d and tacos you CANNOT GO WRONG with the Sausalito Taco Shop.  \n\nThe two most difficult parts of our day were  finishing our plates and...running out of room in our bellies for more food.  \n\nA MUST TRY!More"}
{"review":"Salsalito used to have really good food, but it has slipped badly.  The quality is mediocre and the prices have gone way up!  Black bean soup was bland .  Salad ingredients were fresh, but tomatos were tasteless as was the lime-cilantro dressing, and at $15...twice what it should have cost.  Chips, which cost extra, were greasy.\n\nNice staff and cute location.....but it is now for tourists and has lost this local as a diner.More"}
{"review":"I\u2019ve been here a few times and it just is not a very good place.  It is definitely oriented towards taking as much money from  tourists as they possibly can.  The food is pretty bland and not particularly authentic for anyone who knows Mexican food...even a little bit.More"}

{"review":"Last Thursday, June 26, the taco shop had a soft re-opening.  Not only did it not disappoint; it lived up to the past high standards of excellence and went beyond compliance with the strict protocols restaurants must follow.\n\nDuring their closure they went to work...on deep cleaning and sprucing up the already well-appointed and maintained space.  New paint, d\u00e9cor and freshly stained deck were just some of the improvements.  You feel cleanliness and safety immediately.  The entrance has a colorful rope closure so guests will stop to have a quick forehead temp check and then get a squirt of hand sanitizer.  More than half of their tables have been removed to comply with the required distancing.  \nWhat\u2019s been added is the north parking area has been converted into a charming outdoor dining space with whimsical beach d\u00e9cor, colorful tiled tables with umbrellas are back, a new 3-sided bamboo fence, 3 super large tin planters to border off the area that are plump full of succulents, wooden boats and alongside each one is a fun metal bird sculpture.  All that\u2019s missing is the sand; you\u2019ll still think you\u2019re on a lovely beach in Baja.  Of course, all the tables are at the proper distance and the warmth of the afternoon sun is combined with the soft gentle Bay breeze to create a marvelous environment.\nTheir menu has been scaled down a bit but the food is still absolutely delicious.  Everything is always made from scratch, fresh from the kitchen and served up in colorful dishware.  You cannot go wrong with any item on the menu.  Margaritas are still refreshing and tasty.  \nBack too, is their loyal and hardworking staff of skilled and friendly servers working at the top of their form.    \nThey\u2019ve always lived up to fastidious cleaning; now, even more so \u2013 every surface touched is thoroughly cleaned and sanitized after every guest, ready for the next customers.  \nThis eatery has been a successful favorite for locals and out of area visitors for almost 20 years; treat yourself soon and enjoy a scrumptious meal with your friends and family.More"}
{"review":"I have been fortunate enough to visit Texas and Florida and have eaten some good tacos and burritos. While this place has a nice feel to it - across the water, open air, colourful seating, music playing - the food wasn't a hit out of...the park. We ordered several types of quesadillas and tacos + chips and dips. The quesadillas were good but the meat taco was disappointing. I wouldn't go back here in a hurry. It wasn't bad, it was palatable - just not a 5 star.More"}

Ingredients were not explained on menu  it included mushrooms and other things not specified.  I had chilli...burger.  Didn't see much chilli, all I seemed to have was a load of chilli beans.

{"review":"Went here to have breakfast for dinner on a Saturday night. The diner was very busy so I was expecting it to be pretty amazing - jt was just average. Service was very slow. \n\nI sat at the counter and watched them cook everything. Sandwiches...they were making looked good \/ fair sized portions. My breakfast omelette was a good size but hash browns were undercooked and not seasoned at all. \n\nOverall condition of restaurant was run-down and a little dirty looking. When food is finished cooking it just sits out until run to the table - I have two salads with hot items on them sitting in front of me at the counter for 5 minutes. Odd spot to have that sit in front of customer. \n\nThis place is fine for a quick diner meal but nothing terribly special.More"}
{"review":"Saw lines of people for this place and it got some great reviews.  I am not sure what these people were eating or looking at but this was a HUGE disappointment.  We waited for 10 minutes to get in and then another 15 minutes to...get a server.  If you like sitting close to people this is your place, no room at all.  I got a Belgian Waffle, the worst I have ever had, it was like a loaf of bread, very dry and not fluffy.  We then again waited for our check, which I finally walked up to the counter and asked for my check.  If you want better food and quicker service, Mel's dinner is only a few blocks away.More"}

Since I was solo, got a seat at...the bar. Had a delicious cheeseburger with a Anchor Steam beer. Service was fast and staff was friendly. Place was packed. It was fun watching the cooks whip up all the food orders in the small cooking area. It is a well oiled machine! Had a Rueben sandwich for the second dinner I had here and that was good too. Good experience both times.More"}

{"review":"This CRUSTREAN LOCATION IS RACIST! I have been dining at Crusteceans Los Angeles for years.  I was so excited to find out there was a location in SF. I called the restaurant to see if there were any reservations I also asked how long they...had this location immediately the manager cut me off and said I don\u2019t have time for this are you coming in or not ! I was completely thrown off but thought maybe he was busy and it was cultural difference. I get to the location we were asked to sit down until our table was ready the same manager I believe his name is Klee not sure exactly but he is at the front helping all the customers. He kept telling me there was 20% gratuity added to every order, multiples times before being seated he stated this as if this was going to make me want to leave the restaurant. He kept repeating this as if we aren\u2019t aware of the policy.  I began to notice he only did this to African American customers. I counted 3 African American groups he did this too. Also, I noticed that when white customers walked in he seated them in a different area. He sits black people on one side of the restaurant and white\/ Asian on the other. This made our dining experience very uncomfortable. A large African American  party walked in and obviously they sat us on the side they sit us and I heard the manager talking negatively about them saying they would be loud And they better only pay with one card. I understand every restaurant has there policy\u2019s but it is never okay to racially profile anyone. I will probably never dine at any of there locations again. On top of that the food was terrible the crab was oily and the noodles were not cooked properly!More"}
{"review":"We were able to make our reservations through Yelp. Which was very convenient. Once we checked-in, we were seated right away. The staff was very attentive, and their attention to detail was spectacular. They refilled our drinks frequently and once we were done with a...dish, they quickly cleared the dirty dishes. Their timing was perfect as well. From giving us ample time to settle in, to looking over the menu, and then placing an order. Once we completed our appetizer, like I said, they quickly came around and cleared the dishes and switched them out for our entrees. They bought extra plates for sharing and additional bowls for \u201ctrash\u201d (used to throw the shells into). It felt like they anticipated what we needed and delivered it without us asking for it. The food was very delicious. We ordered the tiger prawns, fried calamari, garlic noodles, and lemon grass chicken. As other reviewers have mentioned, they automatically add their service charge into the bill so additional tipping is optional.More"}
{"review":"This is a must stop whenever I visit to Sfo ! Lovely roasted crab with butter and herbs. Rich butter flavour and savoury! Especially the garlic butter noodle to go with. It.. it is sinful. The meat is juicy and easily cracked shell! Rather messy...buy is enjoyable. Love the mussel too with reach garlic flavour, butter and herbs. Dip the bread into it and savour it ! Yummy.. the fried calamari in Asian style. With salt and pepper plus specially prepared spicy mayonnaise sauce, it is \ud83e\udd24 ! Great night with great wine to company too.. shiok.!More"}
{"review":"Six words: I should have ordered the crab.\n\nI went back and forth, and back and forth debating about getting the crab or the prawns. I opted for the prawns (comes with garlic noodles) while everyone else (four others) ordered the crab.\n\nWhile my dish...was good (not amazing or incredible, just good), I couldn't stop looking at everyone else eating their crab. I was actually slightly envious. A friend shared some of hers with me and I must say, it is some of the best crab I've ever eaten.\n\nPrawns were overcooked and the garlic noodles are not as good as their sister restaurant Thang Long.\n\nIt took way too long for us to receive the bill, so that factors into my 3-star rating. This was my first time eating here and I'll probably just stick to going to Thang Long because it's the same food and dare I say, it\u2019s just better over there?More"}
{"review":"This restaurant is known for its roasted Dungeness Crab and it didn\u2019t disappoint!  The crab is roasted with garlic and other seasonings in a secret recipe of the Vietnamese owner.  I\u2019ve visited the restaurant many times and the menu has many more dishes but crab...is their signature dish.  However don\u2019t miss the the Sea Bass steamed in Ginger, unbelievable tenderness and flavor.  The wine list is extensive with great choices and the bar is excellent!More"}

{"review":"We normally go to another (less expensive) restaurant in the city for Vietnamese crab, but our go-to spot was closed on Tuesday. \n\nHave been to Crustacean a few times before and this will be my last time. Garlic noodles were overcooked and lacked flavor. Crab...lacked favor too and just wasn\u2019t as good as what you can get at rival restaurants. Only thing that was up to par was the salad. \n\nIf you don\u2019t know any better than I\u2019m sure this place would be fine....but there are much better options in the City.More"}
{"review":"My girlfriend and I decided to check this place out a couple of months ago but finally got the chance to visit. In typical San Francisco style, trying to find a parking space became such a pain that we decided just to valet. \n\nNow the...building didn\u2019t look like much but I promise you when you get inside it\u2019s a different ballgame. The service was amazing. We had Benjamin who was great. He welcomed us and told us what he would recommend for food and drinks and we weren\u2019t disappointed. \n\nBenjamin was very attentive to our needs. He was there to clean the table before we even had to ask especially eating crab. \n\nWe both had the Drunken Crab with An\u2019s garlic noodles. I love seafood but not a fan of crab because of the work and the mess that I make.  But these were different crabs. Not only were they large and filling. They were seasoned some how that made the crab meat taste like it had been taken out of the crab cooked, seasoned and put back in the crab.  \n\nAs much as I don\u2019t want to go back to the same place in the same week.  We may be back again tomorrow or the next day.  It\u2019s certainly on my list of favorite places to eat. The next time I\u2019m in San Francisco I will certainly stop by for dinner. \n\nYou all should check them out and if your do, tell\u2019em Drew sent ya!\nY\u2019all be Easy!\nDrew\u270c\ud83c\udffeMore"}
{"review":"We had a relative in town for the night and choose Crustacean for its unique offering of Dungeons Crab cooked in very interesting ways. Our party had both the Roasted and the Drunken crab. The Roasted is cooked with butter and is very delicious in...that buttery kind of way. The Drunken is steamed in wine so there is not alcohol to the finished dish. It is lighter than the Roasted version.  Both use black pepper to give the dish a little bit of heat.\n\nThe service was excellent and very attentive. Always removing the dishes that had accumulated shells. This is a place to take your time to eat your dinner, don't go here for a quick meal, not because of the service, they are very good about you taking you time but for the time it takes to eat a whole crab. \n\nThe menu also includes a large variety of other seafood dishes.\n\nWe noticed a couple of large groups eating here so it looks like a good place for a group.More"}

We were quickly seated, menus were delivered and orders were taken with haste, dishes were cleared and the bill was brought almost with expediency.  Service did not allow for (protein) changes or spice level substitutions on the dishes. I understand this is to keep the dishes as authentic as possible but there were a couple we would have loved to try but our party had food restrictions.\n\nAmbience felt like a traditional (south) East Asian kitchen with Western touches. The restaurant is clean and compact with limited seating areas but did feature a bar. The restaurant at-capacity felt almost squished. Kin Khao doesn't have it's own restroom so you have to use the one in the hotel lobby nextdoor.\n\nValue was pretty solid. Our bill came out to $179.65 for four people, which is not bad considering it's a Michelin-starred restaurant in San Francisco.\n\nI would be interested in coming back and trying their pre-fixe menu (available upon request) and hope the service was less rushed.More"}

{"review":"They open up at 8am.   There was a line waiting outside about 10 minutes prior.  Great view of the bay.\n\nWe had the French toast and the avocado toast.

{"review":"everything is pretty good. the food is delicious, a little expensive, but worth it. the interior is interesting and beautiful. a little cramped. it can be seen that it is not always convenient for waiters to run between tables and not collide with each other....If we are in San Francisco again, we will definitely stop by.

{"review":"Horrendous service, average food. \n\nWe arrived for lunch at about 1:30. Ordered and the food for the four of us arrived one at a time spread over 20 minutes. The server lazily kept leaning over people to get to other tables rather than walking around....No cutlery or napkins laid on the table. The server just dumped them all on the table for us to lay out. \nThe food was so so. The server started clearing away the table and dropped the bill before we had even finished eating. \nThen he wasn\u2019t impressed when he got no tip. Impertinent and Cheeky!\nOn the way out I told another server about how terrible the service was and how average the food was. She told us they were closing soon at 3pm. I mentioned that we would have understood had they told us this at the beginning. She at least apologised while cleaning away everything from the table.More"}

{"review":"Had a variety of tacos - specifically the fried\/battered fish taco, grilled taco and spicy shrimp taco. The chips that came\nout were complementary. They came with salsa and we requested another green salsa which was spicy but amazing. The tacos were all very excellent...- it\u2019s difficult to decide which was the best. The service was a little slow but they were busy and it was fine. Strongly recommendMore"}
{"review":"I would\u2019ve never paid this much for Mexican food in Texas it\u2019s like highway robbery these prices. The food was good but way more then I expected it to be  for 5 people the total was $178! Wow"}
{"review":"My friend and I went when on vacation. I got the kale and quinoa salad and it was amazing. I didn't even care that I wasn't eating tacos, it was that good. However, my friend did get the tacos and they were also amazing. The...only downside was that the music was too loud.More"}
{"review":"While vacationing in San Francisco last month, I ate at this restaurant twice\u2026 First with my wife and kids, and then again several days later with just my wife. We were almost immediately seated both times. I like the decor and dark lighting in this...restaurant\u2026 It gives it a cool vibe. Friendly wait staff who were attentive. I loved the Guajillo braised beef tacos\u2026 Delicious.  I also enjoyed a few cocktails including one that was spectacular\u2026 I don\u2019t recall the name of it, but it was a tad spicy which was awesome.  What a great new fine and so glad we checked it out Dash twice. Definitely would return here again and highly recommend it to others.More"}
{"review":"The husband and I heard from friends that this was a great place. Ate lunch and shared 4 tacos (4 tacos for $20), savory and bursting with flavor!! We had Chili Colorado and Carnitas tacos. Colorado was deep brown with intense flavor. Carnitas was tender...and piled high. Chips were thin and served with warm salsa ( a hint of mint in the salsa). Every dish comes with a tray of 4 sauces\/toppings to enhance you meal. Add a couple of 17 oz Pacifico\u2019s for $7 each. A must for affordable eating in the City.\nTip #1 Order more than one taco-$5.50 each or 4 for $20. \nTip #2 - Eat outside- it right across from Washington Square Park and great people watching. \nTip #3- Get there when they open. Outside seating fills up first and quickly.More"}

{"review":"Sight-seeing In San Francisco works up an appetite. We dropped into Tacolicious which was very highly recommended. It was too late for lunch and too early for dinner. Our waitress didn\u2019t miss a beat, suggesting we come back in 25 minutes for happy hour, and...save some money in the process. So off we went to Washington Square and then back for happy hour margaritas and Clown Tacos, kind of like Jack in the Box Tacos only way better. Seriously the drizzle drazzle of hot sauce is the winning ticket. Pretty decent guacamole and chips too. \nThanks Tacoliciuos and thanks to a very sharp waitress.More"}

{"review":"These tacos won\u2019t change your life or anything, but they were pretty tasty. The fish was fried in a light batter. Fried avocado was good. The salsa variety was good. I liked the atmosphere of the restaurant, with sidewalk seating and indoor seating with big...windows along the sidewalk.More"}

I would give it another shot.More"}

Lot's of garlic and Pesto sauce to soak up w\/all the warm french bread.\nServer kept all our water glasses filled up and our bread basket full of hot bread and soft butter.\nI LOVE this restaurant for it's consistency and there is always something on the menu I want to try.\nParking sucks, but that is also part of the experience.\nReservations are a must.More"}

{"review":"This is an installment of the hybrid Italian steakhouse concept that seems to exist mostly in California (most of which are completely unrelated other than in concept and the name \"Joe's\").  It is retro chic.  I have always really liked it, and it went to...another level when they remodeled a few years ago.  Prices went up a bit, but the overall experience went up a lot.  This is a spot where true locals gather with their families.  I love the veal scallopini sec, the sole piccata, and the pot roast (definitely the best deal on the menu), always with ravioli on the side.  Service is old school and excellent.  The ambiance is 60s cool.  If you want good food in a quantity that won't leave you hungry, you cannot go wrong.\n\nP.S.  Don't even think about getting a seat at the bar when the 49ers are playing.More"}

The club sandwich was very good and also went home.  My Joe\u2019s special was special!!   We had ice cream...for dessert and one order was enough for three to share.

Our food was served within 2 minutes on our table with some Luke warm saaki. \n\nThe food was delicious and sumptuous. Best Ramen I\u2019ve had ever. Will be visiting soon againMore"}

Great place to have a quick meal in JapantownMore"}
{"review":"Good atmosphere and MSG-laden menu. I like to eat clean as much as possible and always ask about MSG at Asian dining places. I realize most will still be dishonest about it if you ask about chemical junk in their food head on. I had...asked about MSG at Marufuku previously and I was told they didn\u2019t use it. It wasn\u2019t until a customer at a table next to ours was asked about allergies and stated she was allergic to MSG the truth came out. The waiter flat out told her most items on their menu had MSG even the mayo!!! WTF??? You don\u2019t need MSG to make mayo!!! People go to Japanese restaurants expecting clean, healthy and natural food. At least that\u2019s the top of mind for most who will favor a Japanese menu over some deep-fried or heavy-greasy fare. \n\nWhat a disaster. I had to hear it from the chef about the reasons for serving ingredients which are known to be harmful to health and not even being transparent about it. I mentioned that I did ask about MSG first time I went there and was effectively lied to. The reply was some mumbling about \u201ceveryone is doing that\u201d and \u201cthese are small quantities\u201d. Basically customers love it so nothing to see here. Well it turns out customers do care. This is a small place with tables pretty close to each other and so I could see people who overheard our conversation push off their plates and lay off their spoons. Nobody wants to be deceived or served toxic chemical crap Marufuku. You are making irresponsible sourcing choices for profit or ignorance. I brought clients to this joint. Not only am I not coming back, I\u2019d like to forewarn as many health-conscious people as I can about this place, because they certainly aren\u2019t likely to tell you.More"}
{"review":"Following other reviewers\u2019 suggestions, we used the Yelp waiting list to hold our place in line while browsing the marketplace.

I would make a point to stop back here next time I\u2019m in town!More"}
{"review":"Located on the edge of Japantown on the second floor of a shopping center. Very small  location but it\u2019s worth the wait. Their spicy ramen is one of my favorites. Very attentive service. Fair prices for good portions. Family friendly but tight seating. Large groups...would be tough.More"}
{"review":"First time trying this place. The serving bowls  are huge! We had several people in our group that were vegetarian and wanted the crepes next door instead. Please note they do not allow you to bring in other food. We had to wait until they...finished eating the crepes so we could be seated. The ramen was okay. I would not say it\u2019s the best I\u2019ve had. It might be because I woke up with bad stomach issues that night after eating it. May had been the raw egg I\u2019m not sure. My stomach isn\u2019t usually sensitive. Or it could of just been something unrelated. The service was excellent! Our waitress was amazing! We didn\u2019t finish our ramen. Wasn\u2019t use to a lot of stew in ramen. But the broth was tasty. We mostly ate the ramen out of it and left a lot of the broth. It\u2019s worth to try if you have never been. It\u2019s a neat place.More"}

The 2 guys had the Kakata Tonkitso DX (less seaweed)...which is served with a nice pork broth and 2 different porks. My wife had the Chicken version with chicken broth. It was also very good. The challenge was actually eating with chopsticks. Our friend finally had enough and got us a couple of forks. Now, we have to find quality Ramen in Ohio.More"}

We opted out of the tasting menu which seemed delicious - but happily created our own shred plate experience wit heirloom tomatoes, albacore tuna - and beautifully prepared Black...Cod .the chocolate peanut butter semi freddo was to die for , and they graciously added a slice of birthday cake.

Great ambience, service and food. Our 8 year old daughter loved it too - particularly the corn lasagne! We will be back! Well done to all concerned at Octavia!More"}

We tried most of the dishes on the menu, including desserts, and all were delicious.  no run-of-the-mill salads and pastas here ... all had unexpected\/wonderful added herbs and flavor combinations.  Attentive service.  \nNote...that this is not as casual as many restaurants in the area.  Some of us were rather underdressed.More"}
{"review":"We stumbled across this restaurant on our first night in San Fran.\nOur hotel was a couple of blocks away, it was dark and we were nervously exploring the area looking for a small quick bite before some much needed sleep.\nThe soft ambient lighting...attracted us like a beacon and so we asked if a table was available for a snack.\nIt turns out the restaurant was hosting a special event in collaboration with Slow Burn Restaurant. A 4 course tasting menu of sharing plates. We were too tired to go elsewhere and the place looked so inviting.\nSo we went for it.\nWow!\nThe eclectic taste combinations and farm to fork ethos was sensational.\nEndive salad with home made curds, macerated strawberries and candid walnuts was absolutely divine!\nA ricotta gnocchi with fava beans was also fantastic. \nThe dishes were all sharing and despite four courses and multiple dishes the balance was perfect.\nThe finale was a two dish dessert of mushroom custard, miso caramel, dark berries and chocolate alongside a delicious granita of rhubarb with thyme crumb. ( I may have some of the combinations wrong, I am very tired, but in my defence I wanted to make sure I wrote this review immediately).\nThe staff were all delightful and the food exquisite.\nWhat a find!!!!More"}

{"review":"Outstanding food on a made-to-order\/seasonal menu. Not a giant selection at any one time, but literally everything is exceptional. The wait staff is extremely attentive (but not overly so) and knowledgeable. Our waiter steered us to great selections both with food and wine pairings (and...an absolutely divine desert). If I still lived in SF, this would be a regular go-to FOR SURE.More"}

Still ready with friendly advice, which seemed kind of hollow by the end. The wine...selection was truly excellent. The biggest problem was still the food.\n\nThe entres were really tasteless. The quail was brodering dry ($65) without seasoning, the bed of eggplant overcooked and it was served without any sause or carbs to balance the dish. \n\nUnless you enjoy shelling out $200 for an evening seasoned only with disappointment, spend your money on a restaurant ha ung kept its Michelin star...More"}

{"review":"This Italian restaurant was very good and I highly recommend it for family\u2019s. The food is amazing and a lot to choose from."}
{"review":"If I am paying over $400 for a meal for 2 I expect a restaurant that is not noisy, has linen tablecloths and has some sort of atmosphere. Although the actual (tasting menu + wine pairing) meal was satisfactory, there were no really outstanding courses....For a restaurant that prizes its reputation on \"local produce\" I dont understand why Peruvian vegetables are on offer?? \nApparently this establishment is considered a \"bargain\" by SF standards. Well....the techies who frequent this place obviously have think that $400 is not much to pay for a meal. I'll stick to Walnut Creek and Oakland.More"}

{"review":"One of San Francisco's best kept secrets is The Rotunda in Neiman Marcus.\n\nIn the heart of Union Square, The Rotunda is perhaps San Francisco's finest settings for lunch or afternoon tea.  A beautiful setting on the 4th floor of Neiman Marcus, dining under a...stained glass dome with beautiful views of Union Square.  As if the beautiful atmosphere wasn't enough, patrons are also served some of the freshest and tastiest food in the city.  Unfortunately The Rotunda is not open for dinner but breakfast or dinner here will carry one through the day.  The meal always starts with a complimentary small cup of consomme which is bewildering but quite pleasant.  A favorite is the fish sandwich which is quite hearty and tasty.  Breaded and fried but not enough to overwhelm the taste of the fish.  The truffle fries are also very fragrant and tasteful.  \n\nAn excellent restaurant that should always be on one's list when visiting!More"}
{"review":"Elegant, good quality high tea at Neiman Marcus.  Good variety of sandwiches, sweets and scones.  Plenty of food to fill you up.  4 or 5 choices of teas to choose from.  Great views of union square.  A tad on the slow side on service but...pretty friendly staff.  Price is righ on with other high teas.  The only thing that bothered my is that they automatically add 20 percent tip to your ticket.  Overall, a good high tea experience.More"}
{"review":"I stumbled across online reviews during my recent visit to SF and decided to try this. I\u2019m so glad I visited. The food is superb and the ire is worth the visit. I had the crab salad and the truffle fries. And the view of...Union Square at my feet. Afterwards, I searched online for the recipe of these amazing fries and ended up buying the Neiman Marcus cookbook. \ud83d\ude02 let\u2019s say this was worthwhile. I\u2019ll be back on my next visit to SF.More"}
{"review":"The place was amazing with a great view of Union Square if your by the window. The food was delicious as well. I wanted to visit due to all the reviews I had seen prior to visiting San Francisco. The staff was super nice and...went out of their way to make our dining experience one to remember.More"}
{"review":"Luxurious place with a wonderful vibe! Service was amazing and the menu includes many different dishes, all worth trying."}
{"review":"This is a great place for lunch, especially if you can sit along the window with a nice view over Union Square.  The food was good and the service was first class.  I would recommend the crab melt sandwich and the cherry tart for dessert....A real hidden oasis.More"}
{"review":"I met up with an old friend and wanted a quiet beautiful relaxing place to reconnect. Mission accomplished. The Rotunda\u2019s atrium lights a fabulous well appointed dining area. There are intimate vignettes for privacy. My friend and I had the goat cheese starter and both...decided on the King Salmon on a bed of beetroot. Delightful afternoon.More"}
{"review":"Great way to celebrate my birthday with friends. First time in San Francisco and first time at the rotunda."}
{"review":"the Rotunda is a very beautiful place! I saw this place on envibe and went there to celebrate my birthday. The food was very tasty, and at the end of dinner I got little birthday dessert. It was SO cute!"}
{"review":"Awesome experience while shopping in San Francisco. The  food  and wine quality were tasty, fresh and better than many restaurants. Must do experience while in San Francisco."}
{"review":"After shopping, we decided to stop by for lunch at the Rotunda restaurant.  Arriving at about 2:30 in the afternoon, with a reservation the place was literally packed.  They close at 400:pm  so they are anxious to move tables.  We had a short wait and...they seated us at a lovely table.  Our waiter took our wine order and wanted to take our lunch order.  We wanted to wait to until after a few sips of wine and he was good with that request.  After ordering our entrees, they came out with delicious popovers for each of us and a small cup of boullion.\nWe ordered :\n-  Burger and fries - Burger was rare just the way I like it and fries were hot and crispy.\n- My husband ordered the Caesar salad topped with white anchovies, croutons which was delicious !\n- We finished with an Affogato for dessert which hit the spot!\n\nThe only minus about our experience was that the busser we had was so anxious to clear the dishes that I didn't get a chance to finish my boullion before he whisked away the cup.  So I learned from  that  so I  guarded my plate and told him I am not finished eating.  The food was very well done and I would definitely return for another .More"}
{"review":"Although the first time here, the venue at these Neiman Marcus stores is well known to us. A beautiful location with great views and very nice and competent staff. Only if the food would be better. The chicken was not of best quality, not well...cooked and the polenta was rather tasteless and the spinach was horribly over cooked and tasted bitter. Not sure why there was so much leek or onions as well. Left the food half finished. The Cobb salad was nice \u2026 but also nothing overly special. So \u2026 average at best.More"}
{"review":"Although the location and view were nice, the food was nothing spectacular, especially for the higher end price. Our champagne was not fully chilled, the fish I had not bursting with flavour, my partner who had the salad complained that it was just not fresh,...and at worst on the turn. The little touches were just not there unfortunately. The waiting staff were very good and were happy to chat, but at the end of a meal its the meal itself that is this most improtant, and this time, the rotunda did not deliver.More"}
{"review":"Wandered in here right at 11 am while my friend's wife was checking out some dresses.  We immediately sat down for lunch given the beautiful dining room and the menu proved to be wonderful as well.  The restaurant filled immediately so reservations are definitely recommended....Very interesting menu with lots of gluten free options and an impressive wine list.  Typical Neiman Marcus crowd makes for fun people watching too.More"}
{"review":"Had a holiday lunch there with friends, and couldn't ask for anything nicer.\nNeiman Marcus has a reputation for the store, and it carries over to the restaurant.\nLovely and delicious cocktails, food, and table setting.\nOur server Dahn made it even better with his...conversation - he is fun and genuine.\nGoing to definitely make this a tradition.More"}
{"review":"Great breakfast, served with a smile by Consuela. Enjoyed a ham and cheese omelette with very tasty hash browns. Reasonably quiet at 7am but passed by latter on and a queue had formed."}
{"review":"Visited for breakfast. Had to queue a short while for a table and it was evident the place was a bit short staffed. Breakfast was good."}
{"review":"Great place for eating generally. We had breakfast and dinner and both times service and food was of a high standard for the US. Nice surroundings and music too. It is popular so you may have to wait but I think it\u2019s worth it. As...with all things in SFO it is very expensive but so are all the poor dining places so at least you get good food here.More"}

{"review":"Very popular spot for breakfast. At peak times 8.30-10am expect to queue for 5-10mins.\nLovely staff and the food is of a good standard. \nWe went twice on our trip"}
{"review":"Great food at reasonable prices. They also serve a complimentary garden salad appetiser and bread with the entree. Delightful French music playing in the background as you sit in a rustic setting, with lots of nostalgia around the walls.\nA very pleasant ambience- not noisy...or crowded. The staff are very friendly and Carlos gave us great, prompt service.More"}
{"review":"Good to very good food for breakfast, but rather expensive. Can be around $40 dollars a person (dependent on how hungry you are I suppose), but should leave you with a fairly full stomach for that rate.\n\nExcellent Banana and Strawberry Nutella French toast.\n\nOutstanding...potato home made hash browns.\n\nPoached eggs (should be a bit more runny) but great ingredients overall.\n\nCoffee\u203c\ufe0f not the best, small amounts and very expensive (especially if adding a non diary milk) and not much caffeine eitherMore"}
{"review":"We had a family gathering of 20 people. They accommodated our group with excellent service. Food was good but this is a diner and not a Michelin restaurant. Coffee could be stepped up a notch."}
{"review":"A very lucky find amidst the metropolis of San Francisco. I visited Roxanne\u2019s on my first night and - feeling tired and jet lagged -  found this to be the perfect cure. Great service, lovely freshly made food, good music, views, and central location next...to Union Square. Highly recommended.More"}
{"review":"This was the most inhospitable place I have ever been. The people here are rude and arrogant. The atmosphere was outright hostile."}
{"review":"Good food, slight mix up with the order for a start but it was quickly resolved. Good atmosphere and nice and central. Would return."}
{"review":"We enjoyed a good, rather expensive, breakfast. Service was very good. Atmosphere was busy. Restroom leaves a lot to be desired."}
{"review":"We had two \" roxanne grande\" breakfasts they were delicious and set us up for the whole day. Nice atmosphere and very friendly helpful staff , the place is not very big and you do need to be patient at busy times"}
{"review":"overcharge warning - our bill with mandatory tip was $116 but they charged $136 to my card. After i complained we had a fiasco situation where they tried to refund the $116 - after a stressful 10 - 15 min back and forth that included...a conversation with my bank i was told they had refunded my bill and i should leave. Needless to say i still paid $136.\n\nEither the software they are using to manage the covers is defective or it\u2019s a scam. Judging by other reviews here it\u2019s a scam and they prey on foreign tourists. Shame as food was nice.More"}
{"review":"Our hotel restaurant was closed so they recommended Roxanne Cafe to us. Despite the queue out the door I am so glad we persevered and waited for a table as the wait was really only about 15 minutes. The decor is lovely and despite the...fact that the restaurant was packed for Saturday morning breakfast the staff were great. There were only 2 wait staff working and they both had smiles and were very attentive. Our waitress Consuela was lovely and considering how rushed off their feet they were they still managed to smile and be friendly which today is rare. It was a long wait for the food almost 40 minutes but we didn\u2019t mind as we knew how busy they were and they were doing their best. When the meals came we really enjoyed them and they were a very generous size.\nWe would definitely return when next in SF.More"}
{"review":"This place is just so friendly, joyous and welcoming. We had a really great time and the staff was superb. We had stake dinner and soup (minestrone) and the food was tasty and very satisfying."}

I love the food, the people, the service, in fact everything about it.\n\nAs a leather Master I love the fact that I can walk my slave in wearing his collar and leash, to say nothing...of his loincloth. Me in full leather. Total acceptance.More"}
{"review":"Great food, and even greater service. Fast service and reasonable prices. BUT for me the attention I get is what make me choose this place . Every time I went either Vite or Robie made sure I was having a good time and were super...kind \n.

{"review":"After 4-year away from San Francisco and the Castro, we returned to Orphan Andy for a visit and it was fantastic.  The Patty Melt, done at medium well, was still sinfully rich and tasty, accompanied by ample of French fries.  The Big 2 ( 2...eggs, 2 bacon strips, 2 sausages, 2 hotcakes, and a choice of coffee, tea or soda) arrived hot and savory.  We also got our favorite waiter, who continued to be conversational, kind and helpful to us and other patrons. This diner is often crowded and people are happy to wait around for a table or settle for an immediate seat\/high chair at the long counter.  The ambiance is cheerful and lively but still conversationally audible at the table.  If we live in San Francisco, we would come here at least once a week.  Orphan Andy opens early and closes late in the evening during the week but opens 24-hour on the weekend.  Enjoy!More"}
{"review":"The food was amazing here. We had a breakfast amongst friends and were served by a friendly and patient guy that despite us being 5 people, was happy to recommend and clarify orders. Denver omelette with a side of bacon with the most delicious orange...juice ever! A definite must do when in The Castro!More"}
{"review":"Orphan Andy's is an old-fashioned diner with good coffee, very good and filling food (especially the hotcakes), and a nice staff who accommodated my disabled companion very well. Although we went for breakfast, every kind of meal is served. Well-located for our purposes, we saw...no reason to look for any other breakfast place. A bit pricey, but this IS San Francisco. Great decor, too.More"}
{"review":"Since i live with a preexisting condition these days its become a dice throw in picking a good Safe Clean restaurant to eat at . This little hole in the wall Castro eatery is falling back into the same Bad Habits as before . Its...always Crowded with people who hang out in the Castro district who dont bother to wash their hands and other parts of their body . I am moving on to a Safer better place now . \n                I realize that this place has high rent to pay but why does it have to jeopardize its customers health .  Sorry little restaurant . But you used to have good food at one time here .and friendly staff .More"}
{"review":"We were In town for the long weekend and started the evening with a bite at Orphan Andy\u2019s and what a good place to start. The service was top notch and personable not to mention on point. The food was tasty and well done. Robbie...was tentative but not overbearing and was helpful even after circling back after a few hours and a few cocktails to help with getting us back to our hotel. Kudos to all of the staff for a great start and end to a fabulous time in the Castro.More"}
{"review":"Sometimes you want to go to a really solid diner type restaurant for some comfort food and Orphan Andy's fits that bill perfectly.  Really solid breakfast served with a smile in a very tiny restaurant with fun decor. The food isn't something mind-blowing - but...it's solid staples and was served quickly.More"}
{"review":"Sure it\u2019s a friendly and eclectic atmosphere but the food is average. One issue I had is that much of the staff didn\u2019t have their nose covered by their mask."}
{"review":"We had a great breakfast here!  We just missed the wait and the food was delicious!  Great atmosphere!!  This is worth a stop!"}
{"review":"One of the greatest places in the world!! \nGreat food and amazing people. \n\nFun and friendly atmosphere always full of interesting people to talk to and open really late."}
{"review":"Very friendly service and a great breakfast here. You may need to pick your times though as seating is a little limited. \n\nStaff were helpful and talkative. The food didn\u2019t take long to arrive and was good quality."}
{"review":"Southern comfort food in industrial setting with an urban flair. Came here for dinner with 4 other friends on a Friday evening around 8 and there was no wait. Reservations can be made in advance with Yelp. The area is spacious and good for big...groups, but the seating upstairs may be too loud if there\u2019s a DJ. Credit cards accepted. Street parking available. There are some vegetarian options. \n\nWe ordered the vegan mac and cheese and the fried tofu for appetizers to split. As a non-vegan, the max and cheese still had a nice creaminess and good flavor. The tofu came with a sweet chili sauce that can be made spicier if you eat the peppers it comes with. For my entree, I had the fried chicken which came with a generous helping of coleslaw and a toasty cornbread. There were three pieces of chicken and it was juicy with good breading. Overall it was a good spot for eating a filling dinner before going out in Oakland.More"}
{"review":"I have loved MUA from it's inception, have attended  birthday parties, art receptions, music events, and even had a first date (leading to a long relationship) there. While the relationship didn't last, MUA has kept going and I think the food has even gotten better....In fact, my  visiting foodie family went absolutely crazy for it. Drinks were marvelous, and our server became our new best friend. We had excellent food and serviceMore"}
{"review":"Went with friends for an early dinner.  The place was loud making it hard to talk for us over 50 folk.  But, the atmosphere was otherwise fairly pleasant.   We were given a carafe of water pretty quickly, but the waiter took a little while to...get to us and when he did, he made a non-committal gesture at us without saying anything.  So, we ordered our entrees and drinks.  A short time later, 2 of the 3 entrees came out.  It was only 5-10 minutes for the third item, but by then, my food had cooled off quite a bit.  However, the soft shell crab was still pretty good and the fries were just fine.  We finished eating and the very efficient bus boy cleared our plates.  A little while later the waiter came back looked at us and said \"do you want menus?\"  I think he was asking about dessert or more drinks, not sure, but he definitely looked very disappointed when we said no.More"}
{"review":"Mua is a great place for food and drinks.  It's a really large space with a bar downstairs and music piped in.  I think they even have a DJ.  The food is small plates so there are many"}
{"review":"This restaurant and bar serves both small and large plates.  The small plates were excellent, with fresh and intense flavors.  Food arrived quickly, and the service was quite good.  \nUnfortunately this is one of the noisiest restaurants I\u2019ve ever experienced.  It\u2019s a cavernous space, with...dining on the second level overlooking dining and the bar on the first floor.  We were a group of 9 seated at a rectangular table at 6:30 on a Saturday; I could only hear the people on either side and directly across from me.  I could not begin to hear the rest of our group.  After one hour, I had a splitting headache.\n\nDespite the excellent food and service, I would not go again.More"}
{"review":"I have been there many times but never took the time to write the review, so here it is. Love the place and atmosphere, waiters are friendly. I have tried all the dishes I listed on all my occasions and it is consistently same quality...and taste. Ok beer selection and cocktails are nothing g special, so I would stick with a beer instead of a cocktail. Place is a bit noisy for a couple, but awesome for friends and big groups.More"}
{"review":"After attending a family party, 3 of decided to check out Mua which had been recommended to us. We're a bit of food snobs used to the fabulous cuisine of San Francisco and Petaluma. \nWe were delightfully surprised. When we got there the restaurant was...fairly full. When we left there were loads of people waiting on a Saturday night. Know that they dont take reservations. \nAfter looking at the menu we decided to share. We ordered a marvelous spray of small bites and the crab Po boy.\nThe calamari was perfect. We also had a wonderful artichoke. The lamb cheeks were extraordinary. The smoked trout salad disappointed only in that we wanted more smoked trout! We also had a warm cheese salad and of course the crab Po boy which came loaded with fries.\nTried as we might we couldn't finish our food. It was all delicious and a fun way to eat dinner.\nIf I'm ever back in Oakland I'd definitely go back!More"}
{"review":"Stopped for dinner after the Warriors game!!!!!\nLoved the vibe and the ambiance of this place.\nStaff was very courteous and helpful. \nOrdered the ahi tuna appetizer and went with the Tagine lamb and the vegetarian Ragout.\nEach and every item was full of flavor...and super tasty!!!!! The lamb was so tender and juicy. Fell off the bone goodness!!!!! The tuna was plated with a salad and it was delicious!!!! The ragout had a perfect blend of vegetables.\nLoved each food item.\nA must if you're in the area.More"}
{"review":"The no cheese Mac and Cheese is a MUST if you\u2019re a Mac and cheese fan.  It\u2019s made with butternut squash and cream instead of cheese, over baby shell pasta.  Also the bone marrow with toast is divine and the crab cakes are fresh, fluffy...tasteful morsels.  The one dish to miss is the beet salad.  Nothing special, imaginative or memorable about it.  It doesn\u2019t belong with the previous options. Chunks of beets, a few plops of goat cheese and chopped greens\u2014no discernible dressing to tie it all together.  The pecan tart with ice cream for dessert was very good.  Wine list is excellent.   Enjoyed the odd artwork such as taxidermy sheep heads wearing wigs,  strange sculptures under glass using weird stuff found outside.  A DJ upstairs played upbeat techno selections.  The restaurant is busy even on weekday evenings.  Make a reservation! Waiter was outstanding. Friendly and made recommendations that were spot on.More"}
{"review":"A bad experience indeed! So noisy and crowded   Impossible to talk or walk. We went to celebrate a birthday as the photos were inviting - NOT!\nThis is housed in a warehouse, DJ playing and food average."}
{"review":"The restaurant is tucked away amidst auto row and in a brick building that may have been an auto repair place.  It's a great space with a cozy bar area area up front and a big two story open space for most table dining.  It...is industrial but with a lot of style.  Very arty.  It's usually full and lots of energy.  The DJ is spinning up in the loft on weekends.\nThe food is quite good.  A solid tapas type section with a cross section of mains.  Not extensive but they cover the subject.  Two of us ordered tapas and the other two had main courses.  The trout salad was very nice followed by the burratta, tomato salad which was also delicious.  We finished with the lamb cheeks which were braised and in a killer sauce, almost like a variation of mole but not quite as thick.  The others had the salmon and the chicken milanese which were tasty although the salmon was nothing imaginative.  We did have the pineapple upside down cake and coconut ice cream that we split four ways and it was amazing.  The wine list is broad enough but not bargain.  At $230 for 4 with a bottle and two glasses of wine, it seems high given the fact that I was still a little hungry.  Given the business they are doing, that doesn't seem to be a problem.More"}
{"review":"We went here and the place is absolutely very busy on a rainy night.\nWe ordered the bone marrow, crab cake and the 1 pound steak.  The dishes are appetizing and very filling.  Only got to eat 1 out 3 bonemarrow.  The crab cake is...great and so is the steak, huge servings for us Asians.  A nice feel of the place but not for me,  too crowded!More"}
{"review":"The bone marrow was wonderful. The mushroom on toast was very good. The prawns were OK, could have used more fresh garlic. I really miss Alejandro in San Francisco for this dish. The fried chicken was not very good, no flavor.  The polenta was greasy...and the sauce was so spicy it destroyed the taste of the polenta.The place is definitely for a young crowd. The music was so loud we had to scream at each other to be heard. Besides the fact that it was not enjoyable music. Just a lot of loud noise.There were four of us. The service was very slow. They also need to update their website on the wine corkage fee. The site said $20.00 and they charged $30.00.More"}
{"review":"We shared fried chicken, duck confit, and burger n fries...all delicious with unusual touches...aioli on the burger...no dessert for us, because portions are generous! Wide selection of cocktails, beers and wines.. loved the sparkling rose Pinot Noir..."}
{"review":"Unfortunately the negative ending to a fantastic meal is what sticks with me.  As we went to leave one of the bar staff came after us loudly asking if we had paid. Please, please people come up with a  better way to check on who...has and hasn't paid. And she certainly  wasn't quite or discrete when trying to find out if we had paid, or if we were actually dining and ditching. At 52 years old I think it's  a bit late for me to start doing that. Luckily we passed a bartenders who'd been serving us to help sort this out.  We stood  waiting like school kids in trouble until the lady who made the accusation yelled down to us we were ok. She didn't even come over to talk to us personally or even apologize.  We were stunned someone would talk to us like that and accuse us of not paying. We sat at the bar for ages, my friend sat while I was in restroom and then someone chases after us? I actually attempted to take it up with the restaurant, contacting them twice, but no response.\nThis was an unfortunate ending to what had been a fantastic evening.  Super lively hip atmosphere,  packed inside with a great mix of people and from the outside you would never know what's going on inside. Got a seat at the bar fast, friendly staff, amazing food and all other diners around so friendly and happy. I loved it all.\nToo bad Mua doesn't have a better plan on how to check on bills paid, or how to approach customers if there is a query. And finally it would have been so nice to talk to someone directly just to personally express my disappointment.  Every paying customer should be treated with respect and appreciation.  I would definitely return as this is an amazing place but I have been left with a sour taste regarding my evening.More"}

{"review":"The Prospect is a good high-end restaurant with nice ambience and great service. I have been to this restaurant a couple of times in the last 6 months and have had a good experience both times. \n\nDuring the last visit, I found that the salad...was good and the dessert (ice cream with tart) was great. The Sangiovese wine was very good too. The main entree (Spicy Chickpea, Cauliflower & Butternut Squash Stew) was very bland and not at all spicy. Other than that, everything was very tasty.More"}
{"review":"Went to dinner here for a business trip. Food is quite tasty and the service was excellent. I would highly recommend the duck liver mousse, not quite the foie gras that I love but a close second. The steaks were cooked perfectly and the sides...were sharable. Lovely place!More"}

Came in for happy hour but after happy hour ended  they had this amazing wine list called \u201cThe Post\u201d they had an awesome selection of wine bottles for only 40 bucks! (...yes you read that correctly only 40 bucks). The list was available in the lounge area which had the perfect atmosphere.This place did not disappoint It was a great way to end my day. I will definitely be back to enjoy more off of that Post list !!!More"}
{"review":"This place had kind of a weird vibe. Since it\u2019s in the financial district, it\u2019s big and feels super corporate. The menu was kind of funny \u2014 there was a page of food, a page of wine, and then a binder of drinks and a...bigger binder of wine.\n\nFood is gorgeously plated and pretty good. Not many vegetarian options but the risotto was good. If you don\u2019t drink I wouldn\u2019t recommend this place. But any business meal \u2014 this works.More"}
{"review":"This is a trend: centemporary dining rooms, sophisticated entrees and teeny-tiny portions. Don't expect to be fully fed there. But the salads and entrees are really good.\nPrices are well commensurate with the Financial District. Good business-like atmosphere."}

The food was well prepared, fresh and quite good.\n\nA plus for me: the place has excellent acoustics and even though restaurant was full, the noise level was quite comfortable, unlike many restaurants...that you have to almost scream to talk to the person next to you.More"}
{"review":"Went early on a Friday night. The bar area was busy and very attractive. \nMy husband and I were seated in the dining area and had lovely service. Sophie was our server, and her recommendations were excellent. \n\nFor a first course we shared the chilled...Dungeness crabmeat salad, lovely flavor and descent size portion. For dinner I had the seared sea scallops, which were really tasty and well prepared.  My husband ordered the Liberty Farms Duck Breast. All the accoutrements with both dinners were delicious and unique.  \nFor dessert we loved the sticky toffee cake. My only critique is that the walnut English toffee candy was so hard, I was afraid that I would break a tooth if I indulged in the candy.More"}
{"review":"In the financial district and near the water, this restaurant is elegant yet comfortable.  Highly recommend the scallops, chitarra and asparagus appetizers.

{"review":"This was so bad. Fake Italian good. I seriously cannot believe anyone recommended this place. It was full of tourists and Chianti wine in a raffia bag, which is a sure sure sign that you do not want to trust this place! I had the...eggplant Parmesan, and it had so much creamy ricotta with no flavor and sliced tomatoes in it. The tomatoes were bland and had no flavor. The penne was over cooked and the sauce was less than mediocre. Run do not walk away from this place as quickly as you can!More"}

It looked good and it was in a large crock but it was very tasteless \n2. Chicken Parm portion was average for price. Some of the chicken was good but another piece was very chewy - couldn\u2019t eat it.\n3. Way too much cheese on the chicken parm\n4. I had angel hair pasta as my side - pasta cooked well but pomodoro sauce was also bland.More"}

It was mid week so the place was pretty quiet.\nWe both...found the restaurant to be charming and intimate. \nOur server Alex a long time employee took a bit of warming up, but after a bit, he was quite engaging.\nThe prices are really reasonable for both the service, ambiance, quantity and quality.\nWe started w\/the Calamari Fritti ($17), which was quite good but pretty skimpy and they could have skipped the fried artichoke hearts and just added more Calamari. Great dipping sauce, not the standard seafood sauce.\nMy friend had the Eggplant Parm ($20) which she loved and I had the Penne Bolognese ($20) at the suggestion of another guest. Servings were huge and food was hot. I was a tad disappointed in the Bolognese sauce. It was really chunky with meat and nicely thick and not runny or watery but was quite flavorless. It needed a lot more seasoning or Red Wine or something. Not what I'm usually used to.\nWe each had a coffee which was made per cup and delicious.\nI will be back and try something else.\nOh and Alex does warm up after a bit. Old school charm and finesse.More"}
{"review":"We ate here the night before one of our party was running the SF marathon, for carb loading! It is a classic Italian I would say, the decor is fairly old fashioned and the dining room is on the small side. We made a reservation,...which is probably a good idea given the compact nature of the restaurant, and were greeted efficiently, but in a somewhat unsmiling manner that is atypical of Italian restaurants in my experience. However, nothing to complain about, although this fairly taciturn service was repeated throughout the meal.\n\nThis is not your boisterous, noisy Italian restaurant. At least it wasn't when we visited although, admittedly, it was very early when we sat down to dinner. It is reserved and easy to hold conversations across the table. The food is first class. Well presented, flavorsome and overall very well done. Many of the classics are represented here including many options for pasta (of course) and all of the dishes we ordered were excellent including the calamari we ordered for the table which is something of an appetizer staple, at least for us.\n\nSF is rightly infamous as one, if not the, most expensive cities in the US so easting downtown is never going to be cheap, but overall the value is there when the quality is good and here it most certainly is. Definitely worth seeking out, it sits on a street corner not far from Union Square.More"}

We were a bit on the early side for dinner and got to meet the owner who served us.  They...actually survived  the pandemic and barely made it. It is small on the corner and holds maybe 30 diners at once.  It is delicious, the staff is so friendly, and the prices are above average but not expensive.More"}

{"review":"We're fairly local so we've been to Foley's quite a few times. Stopped in on Saturday night specifically because I wanted the fish chowder. Wow that chowder is better than anyone else's that I can think of!  It comes with fabulous brown bread\/butter that unfortunately...was a bit stale on this visit. Hubs got a panini w\/fries and a side of curry sauce for the fries. That was pretty meh - so he would not order that again ... the curry sauce is really thin\/watery so was not a good curry \"dipping sauce\" that you'd get in a Celtic pub. Drinks were good ... I can appreciate for a pub they have really good wine options and of course, the Guinness is always grand. The best thing about this pub is service at the bar. I've had the same bartenders a few times and they are awesome. Working very hard to keep everyone's drinks topped up.More"}
{"review":"Great Irish Pub in a great location.  Close to everything.  Pretty loud with plenty of music by the band and people drinking and having a good time.  Decent service. The waitress needed to check on us a bit more and not super friendly.  The Corn...Beef and Cabbage was the best I have ever had.  Huge potions with tons of corn beef, cabbage mashed potatoes and little new potatoes.  Definitely more than one person can eat.  Great sauce on the dish as well.  The fish and chips were crispy and fresh.  The fries great.  Not to of the skinny fries.  Great batter on the fish.  The lamb shank meal was fall of the bone tender.  A great value for the price.  Overall, a great experience.More"}

Would go back on a weekend to hear the music....Our waitress was very efficient and we had a great chat with the manageress.  Located close to Union  square it's a nice change from steakhouses and Asian food restaurants.  And if you want news from Ireland...it's the place to meet.More"}
{"review":"Close to our hotel so tried for dinner one night, a burger & Fish and Chips, excellent food, service and a decent enough price for what we had.\nIt was busy but not too noisy.\n\nSecond visit on the last night of stay in SF...was a different event  - the place was so noisy you could not have a conversation with someone sitting at your table, let alone hear the waitress.\nHaving sat down and decided not to stay we were moved to another table (A slight improvement) again the food and service was good.\n\nIt's a shame the TV sound needed to be so loud, which in turn makes people shout to each other making it worse.  OK it's America, there is sport on but it does not need to take over the entire pub making it uncomfortable.\n\nIf it wasn't for the good food\/service I would have given it 3 stars - if your not a sports bar focus on the pub aspect and maybe I would have given 5.More"}
{"review":"we had a meal here recently. The food was just about average, certainly  nothing special.\nThe Guinness, for an Irish bar was horrible. I asked for a half pint and was brought a pint. When I pointed this out to the waitress she just ignored...me and walked away. I was charged the full price for a pint  - even though I could not finish it. The waitress was so unpleasent  and annoying that we refused to give her a tip. A completely unenjoyable nightMore"}

{"review":"These guys are crazy racist, super rude an humiliating dumb bunch of folks! They are just in the wrong line of business. We were 5 guys 1 girl group. I am 36 year old woman. Upon order the server asked me for a physical ID...- I showed my ID and she went away saying I will only accept physical ID. \n\nI walked up to the manager and asked why do you need a physical ID. What is the law? What you need to check. I felt they took physical ID as the reason to just not serve us. They actually had put us in an area where there was NO ONE Else in otherwise crowded pub. If you know what I mean, as if it\u2019s embarrassing to even have us inside.\n\nThe owner soon came out and said- \u201chey would you shut up and listen. You go home and get your ID or just side down here and don\u2019t drink\u201d - it was so shocking that I told her look I am here with my team and let us know if you don\u2019t want to serve us.\n\nEverytime she came to take the order she would just repeat \u201cif you share your drink with this WOMAN I will THROW you out\u201d. I assured her that I am not gonna drink- I understand her concern if that\u2019s the law. \n\nShe again came SHOUTING at me with her fingered shaking aggressively saying I will throw you out if you drink. This time I said I don\u2019t like how you are behaving. You are very rude. Why are you shouting - no one gets to behave this way. She collected all the drinks and food on the table and said I am the owner get out and never comeback on my property!!!\n\nWhile I was walking out she kept pushing me! Well that\u2019s a typical racist Irish bar- just unfortunately not in Ireland ( where this is common behaviour) but is SF where you least expect. \n\nI hope people take note of my review and not support such a business.More"}
{"review":"First visit to San Francisco for St. Paddy's Parade.  After parade we  had dinner in the restaurant. It was fantastic, wait staff very accodating, food delicious. Afterwards we went to The Cellar for the dueling pianos show.  While waiting we ordered drinks at the bar....I specifically ordered a single shot of Titos and a tall glass of water with a couple of limes.  I watched the bartender pour 2 shots.  I stopped him and said that I only ordered 1 shot.  He just looked at me and with a little flip of his head and hand filled the rest of the glass with water and sat it down on the bar in front of me.  I asked if I could have a few slices of lime and he grabbed one and tossed it in my drink.  I took a sip, but because it had 2 shots, I really wanted a few more slices of lime.   I asked several more times only to be ignored as if I was invisible.   My friend ordered something and was helped right away.  I asked again & he still ignored me.  There was a pencil on the bar so I wrote if I could please have a few more limes for my drink on a napkin.  Ignored.  \nWe left the bar and found a table.  The female server during the piano show was wonderful.   \nShort guy behind the bar, not so much.More"}
{"review":"I can\u2019t speak to eating in the restaurant. We ordered takeout from Nopalito on SF2Bay.  Guacamole was delicious. Chips them selves were a bit thick, tasteless and greasy, but worked well with the guacamole. Tamales were OK. My main objection to the meal was the...posole which had great flavor, but the meat was incredibly fatty. Maybe that\u2019s the way peasants make it in Mexico, but it\u2019s not the way I make it.More"}

{"review":"A coworker and I were in San Francisco for a conference and had some time to kill on Sunday. I am a fan of Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives so I try to look for restaurants when I travel. Nopalito was on this list so we...decided to go here for lunch. It is advertised as an organic, sustainable restaurant. It does seem a little heavy on the vegan side for me, but they still have a lot of great food. I ordered the Quesadilla Roja con Chicharron and my coworker got the Vegetables A La Plancha. In addition, we ordered the inhouse made chips and guacamole. Everything was fresh and delicious. The food came to the table relatively quickly. If you are not prepared though, ordering food is very modern and technology based. You scan a QR code which takes you to Toast Order. From this app you order and pay for all of your food. So make sure you have your smart phone with you when you go.More"}

{"review":"This restaurant takes everyday Mexican food and elevates it a level or two into a wonderful dining experience.  The dishes are elegant looking and the flavor complexity is remarkable.  I'm gluten free and was delighted to find an empanada that I could eat.  It was...fabulous; it looked like it was prepared for a celebration, covered with a confetti of fresh herbs and a beautiful undulating drizzle of crema,  It was a perfect lunch portion; no appetizer or dessert needed.  The ginger lemonade was very refreshing, and they also had lot of beer, wine and mezcal to choose from.  My husband had scallops, which he said were perfectly cooked and our son had enchiladas that he raved about.  We will definitely return when we are in that part of San Francisco again.  Just wish they would open a Berkeley branch.More"}

Both of us had the Gorditas Campechanas and the flavor was excellent....Fresh and well prepared. Good salsas and the guacamole was to die for. I had one margarita and it was well poured so no complaints there.\n\nService was attentive. Table was a little cramped as we were placed within 2 feet of another couple. This is a pet peeve of mine but in a smaller space I realize it is necessary sometimes. I deducted 1 star for this so if you don't have issues with this don't let that deter you.\n\nOverall A+.More"}

I also chose a fruit cup as my side dish and this was a lovely selection of fresh fruit.More"}
{"review":"We were staying at the Handlery Hotel around the corner, which currently doesn\u2019t have its own cafe or hotel restaurant - a casualty of the pandemic - but they do offer a 20% discount at the Cafe Mason for the duration of your stay, which...proved to be great value as we were staying at the hotel for ten days. The cafe is a popular breakfast diner, possibly because there are so many hotels nearby, and  most mornings there was a small wait to get in. \n\nThere is a wide choice of menu items, including eggs, bacon, pancakes, omelettes, and Mexican dishes, to name just a few, but we opted most days for the tasty eggs over-easy with crisp bacon, sourdough toast, coffee, and a huge side of fresh fruit salad. My other half opted for a little variety with Eggs Benedict on one day, and pancakes with blueberry sauce on another, both of which looked delicious. The food was so good, we ended up skipping lunch most days.\n\nService is friendly and attentive, and we appreciated the regular refills of coffee!More"}

{"review":"My wife and I found this place after both feeling like getting pizza. The staff was friendly and the pizza was delicious. It's certainly thick deep dish pizza, and they were generous with the toppings, cheese, and sauce. It's a little pricey at 26ish dollars...for a large pizza, but a large will easily feed two people. The pizza came out hot and fresh and I enjoyed every bite. My wife and I each decided to get our own small pizza and had plenty left over. The garlic bread was more cheese bread than garlic, but still good. Tip: If you're looking for something fun to do after eating here go to Emporium. It's an adults only arcade about two blocks away.More"}
{"review":"I have spent lots of time in Chicago and love the pizza.  My wife pushes us to drive 120 miles just to eat pizza here.  Before we lived in Detroit metro and we would drive over to Chicago during the weekend to eat the pizza....Living on the west coast there seemed to be no place that had that thick pie we love.  Then we discovered Little Star.  This pizza is the best Chicago pie I have eaten in years.  Tastes exactly like the amount Chicago pizza you get in Chicago.  Thick, juicy, great sauce and the rest of the toppings and cheese just oozes out.  Excellent all around.  Please note it takes a bit longer to cook one of these compared to a normal pizza.  Its more than an inch thick.  I can eat about 4 pieces of Little Caesars Pepperoni pizza.  I can eat one piece of Little Stars and maybe a couple of bits of another piece.  A typical Little Stars pizza feels like it weighs a few pounds as well.  Good eating though, our family loves it and we are sure to take some home for later.  Its excellent.More"}

Really small pieces of fish inside lot's of greasy batter. So much batter, that when it fell off, you were left with a fish stick size piece of fish.\nFor $25, I shall not be back.

{"review":"My wife and I got a quick bite to eat which included the crab prepared in wine and butter and the clam  chowder. Both were excellent. Our wait staff were attentive and kind. Most impressively after leaving we walked down the street a block only...to realize that I had left my camera bag. When I turned around to go back,  an employee from the restaurant was running after us with the bag to return it to us! Total class act overall!More"}
{"review":"Woodhouse is within walking distance from the Muni station. Try the crab and squid ink linguine, that is topped with caviar. Lobster and crab rolls are good. And the clam chowder comes with oyster crackers. But the bowl serving may be a bit too heavy...even for sharing. Overall a satisfying meal.More"}
{"review":"For our quarterly girls get together, we met here for lunch on a Saturday at 1 pm and there are no reservations so luckily it wasn't too busy at that hour so we were seated once we all arrived.  This place is small and cozy...and the service is friendly and attentive.  I ordered the mussels with garlic bread, two of us ordered the fish and chips, stuffed artichokes with  shrimp and crab, and avocado and shrimp roll.  Everyone enjoyed their entrees but my friends had to add their own salt to their fish and chips as perhaps the cook doesn't add seasoning to the batter.  My mussels were delish and I enjoyed dipping my garlic bread into the broth!  If you decide to come here, take public transportation as parking can be tough.More"}
{"review":"If you're visiting or even live there, this is definitely a great spot to check out! The seafood was delicious and the servers were courteous."}
{"review":"Late nite to restaurant from TA reviews \nGot fish tacos and stuffed artichoke \nBoth very good \nNice vibe\nGood service"}
{"review":"It was so good we went two nights in a row! The food was absolutely amazing!  Do not miss going to this place. I don\u2019t think I would bring my little kids here, but definitely a night out with your significant other or friends."}
{"review":"This highly regarded and difficult to secure reservation was absolutely meh. The portions were small, options limited and taste ok. Def not worth the hype. Also beware, they add tip\u2014even for 4- but don\u2019t point it out, so you could pay\nmore than you want...if you aren\u2019t careful.More"}
{"review":"Right from the start the hostess, who\u2019s name I did not get, was so nice and welcoming. We were a little late to our reservation due to a bad uber driver lol. I was able to email the restaurant and let them know, so it...was a little stressful. We weren\u2019t sure if we would be able to dine here. So it helped alot that we were greeted in with a huge smile and welcomed in.\nThis was our first experience here. Our servers and the rest of the staff were just so nice, helpful with understanding the menu and always made sure we were doing okay. The food was just ridiculously good. We shared the hamachi crudo and shishido peppers as an appetizer. I had the squid ink pasta. Ugghhh the flavors im these dishes sooo yummy. Simple presentations but you can taste the love in these dishes. I can\u2019t remember the names of the other entrees we had but it was all so enjoyable. \nI hope to be back when I visit SF againMore"}
{"review":"We visited Flour + Water yesterday to celebrate a birthday. The music was awkwardly too loud to hear the rotating band of waiters attempt to describe each plate through the tasting menu. The food was good but not great, and for the roughly $1k for...four people I won\u2019t be back anytime soon. \n\nOne person in our party selected the vegetarian tasting menu while the other three selected the normal tasting menu. Our plates came out mismatched and incorrectly portioned. The service wasn\u2019t horrible but it definitely didn\u2019t justify the price\u2014imagine the loudness of an Ibiza beachside club, with throbbing bass, and you at your table crammed in the corner with masked waiters fumbling plates and the few words that escaped the music and masks were glazed with sass. Yikesaroni!More"}
{"review":"The sandwiches are huge. We were here at lunch time. They have mostly sandwiches for lunch.\nI had eggplant parmesan sandwich. And my husband tried their \"special\" of the day.\nYou enjoy a sandwich at lunch, and you don't need dinner after that:)"}
{"review":"This is a review of the flour + water location on valencia (which doesn't appear to have a separate TA entry).  We went there for dinner after seeing a show.  \n\nFrom browsing their website I saw a \"Book Now\" link to Resy which surprised me...because I had heard they didn't take reservations.  I went ahead and made a booking.  When we showed up at the restaurant we were confronted by a staffer who pretty rudely said \"we don't take reservations\" to which I said I was confused and she eventually said \"that was for our other location. we don't take reservations.\"  Boy, talk about an unpleasant greeting!  She informed us it'd be a 45 min wait so we decided to wait.  After walking around Valencia St we headed back to wait at f+w.  \n\nInstead of the surly staffer there was a different woman at the front. This woman, I think her name is Arele (not sure of the spelling), was an absolute joy!  She was friendly, warm, welcoming, and helpful.  Despite having to tell people that they had an hour wait, she did it with a smile and pure charm.  She offered an outside table under heaters which we declined, saying we could wait for an inside table.  Arele more than made up for the initial unpleasant greeting we had received.  Our waitress was similarly chipper and friendly.  \n\nEventually we got seated and ordered a bunch of food including mozzarella sticks, a kale salad, a few pies, and eventually desert.  All the food was great, zero complaints.  It was a bit pricey coming out to over $300 for 4 of us, but that included a bottle of wine, a couple cocktails, and a couple beers.More"}
{"review":"Great location - small with a cozy ambiance and with amazing pasta. Reservations open at midnight 28 days before the date you want, and within 24h, most of the good times are gone. There are seatings 5:30\/5:45, 7:30\/7:45 and 9:30\/9:45 so if you want something...around 7, book at midnight. It will likely be gone in the morning.\n\nThere is a walk in seating but if you're not there by opening, you can expect a 3 hour wait.\n\nBut yes, the pasta is worth it.More"}
{"review":"Uncomfortable chairs. Loud music that doesn\u2019t match the food. Service suboptimal- waiters aren\u2019t \u201cprofessional waiters\u201d and some have no idea how to wait table. Nice small italian wine menu for outrageous prices ( a lot of the wines on the list are considered table wines...in Italy). Pizza dough needs improvement. Boudin - dessert, delicious, outstanding! Panna cotta- terrible, inedible. Pasta dishes- they are trying too hard. Pasta is a simple dish with one , at most two ingredients.... Need to study with a good traditional italian chef. \nI wish them good luck. Will not return.More"}
{"review":"We were a party of three and tried five different pastas. All were very good, we liked the one with balsamico best. \nWine was good, especially the Valpolicella and the Sangiovese. \nAfter having paid one of us was still finishing his wine when the waitress...already cleared the table. That was really quite disturbing.More"}
{"review":"Would highly recommend the vegetarian pasta tasting menu...all dishes were gorgeous and even my husband who thought it might be too adventurous for him really enjoyed it! \n\nThere was a slight discrepancy (as the waitress put it) with our first dish but I let them...know and they brought an extra dish to say sorry - great service. \n\nMy only slightly negative comment would be that the food came out very quickly. It didn\u2019t matter to us as we were super jet lagged but I think usually we would have rather enjoyed the evening for a little longer. I think that is purely just because of the amount of people that want to go there that they get the food out so quickly. \n\nOverall excellent meal and would love to come back next time we\u2019re in San Fran! Thanks!More"}
{"review":"Pasta dishes live up to their reputation, but the dishes we ordered were delivered so quickly and so haphazardly that our table was jammed with plates and many dishes were lukewarm by the time we ate them.  Servers were very nice, but the meal felt...rushed as if the restaurant wanted us in, fed and out quickly.  The pizza was underwhelming--easy to find better pizza in SF.More"}
{"review":"Flour + Water is well worth the wait.  We had a group of five people.  The service is excellent and food was amazing.  The flavors in the food popped and were so good we ordered seconds.  We enjoyed taleggio scarpinocc, Pizza margherita, tagliatelle with veal...bolognese, and Pizza Fiore di zucca. I am definitely going back.More"}
{"review":"Worth a trip to the mission district.  Innovative cuisine makes the wait worthwhile.  If there is a long wait leave your cell phone number and go to Shotwell's Bar, a few blocks away."}
{"review":"Short and sweet GREAT FOOD. When I come back in the area I will go back.! No question it's hard to find good food that you can recommend, not with this place."}

{"review":"Returning to an old favorite.  Walked in for a quick lunch and we were greeted by Ramiro, the managing partner of the restaurant.  What a delight gentleman.  Seated as by the window and chatted with us for a bit.  Beautiful and well maintained restaurant.  Service...and lunch was outstanding.  Highly recommend.More"}
{"review":"The location is great and the food is acceptable. Unremarkable at best and a bit overpriced, but if you have the money, go for it. The waiter was nice but a bit aloft. There are many great and less expensive places to eat in Oakland....It was close to the hotel and we didn't want to walk around at night. We would eat there again and do recommend it to the average American. If you are from across the pond don't expect what is typical fine dining in Europe.More"}
{"review":"The best calamari steaks almondine ever!  So tender and flavourful. Staff was very attentive. Easy valet parking with validation from Scott\u2019s."}
{"review":"First of all corkage is $40 for a bottle of wine!!  We didn't ask.  I thought it was a mistake on the bill.\n\nSecondly we ordered salads (there were 5 of us) and they charged $8 to spit two salads.  Had we known we could...have\/would have shared the salads without them plating it without telling us there would be an extra charge.\n\nThat said the fish was good as were the sides.  One of us ordered a burger that was very dry and over cooked.  $460 before tip for 5 people.  I don't think I would go back again.  Our waiter disappeared and the service was lacking after that.More"}
{"review":"This place has great service great atmosphere, but unfortunately they are lacking when it comes to.the food. I ordered Surf and turf and was disappointed with the quality of the filet.and the flavor.of.the lobster"}
{"review":"We all know how expensive eating out in the US is but this restaurant, compared to others we visited in Oakland and other parts of Northern California, is very over-priced for what you get. Four adults and one child were in our party. One adult...ordered the Boston Chowder and the Clam Linguini and said both were very poor. Two had oysters (very good and reasonably priced) and the Seafood Saut\u00e9 - for me the seafood was overcooked and lost in a poor, non-descript, wine\/buttery sauce. The best thing about the plate was the wild rice and if the vegetables had been at least warm they would also have been nice. We were a combination of locals and visitors and neither couple was particularly happy with a check plus tip of over $600.00 for a mediocre mid-afternoon meal. Our server was very pleasant and the ambiance is very nice but the food needs to improve to warrant the prices.More"}
{"review":"Pleasantly surprised by this lovely waterfront dining experience which I enjoyed solo secondary to travel irregularities.\nI enjoyed the New England or Boston clam chowder as an appetizer and would highly recommend the swordfish with dungess crab. Presentation was beautiful, vegetables perfect.\nWait staff very...attentive and view enjoyable.\nWould revisit.\nPlan to spend a little money for your mealMore"}
{"review":"Service was excellent!!! Our server could not have been more pleasant or efficient. The food was uneven.  There were six of us.  Three really enjoyed their meals. One felt their meal was good but not excellent. Two were disappointed.  We were celebrating a birthday and...LOVED the surprise dessert, flower and photo. The ambiance is lovely.More"}
{"review":"Was here for Sunday Brunch. The service and live music was great, but the food was just mediocre. The 1\/4 inch crab cake Benedict left me unsatisfied\u2014not enough crab for the price. Potato fingerlings were cold, soggy and not well seasoned. You can get more...bang for your buck somewhere else.More"}
{"review":"We enjoyed sitting outside and enjoying the view. The service was excellent. Although expensive, the food was excellent - Cioppino and Halibut."}
{"review":"We were celebrating out anniversary so I made reservations aty Scott's.  A day before the reservation they texted us to confirm and I responded with a YES.  When we arrived, the host immediately showed is to a window table with a view of the channel...and boats passing by.  Our waitress, Angela, was super nice and very attentive, but not overbearingly so.  I had surf & turf and my sweetie had a crab salad followed by fresh lobster.\nThe food was amazing and they surprised us with a nice dessert and a red rose to celebrate our anniversary.\nWe will be back.More"}
{"review":"My husband ordered blackened catfish, and it was fine.  I ordered pecan or cashew shrimp - not sure which nut was supposed to come with the shrimp, but the dish did not include any nuts.  At first, I thought the nuts were crushed and mixed...into the sauce, but the server said that the nuts were supposed to be whole.  She also did not see any nuts on my plate.\n\nThe server took away that untouched dish, and I then requested the macadamia crusted halibut - again no sign or taste of any macadamia nuts.  I kept my mouth shut this time and took a few bites before giving up.\n\nYou may say that this has nothing to do with the server, but we also ordered a salad.  I mentioned to the server that I would share the salad with my husband.  Upon bringing the salad, the server proudly announced that she had put it on two plates for us.  Well, instead of $20, the salad became $24 due to the extra plate.  Nowhere on the menu was there a mention of an extra charge for the extra plate.  If it had been mentioned, I would have asked for the salad to remain on one single plate.\n\nUpon presenting us with the bill, the server also \"generously\" mentioned that she did not charge me for the shrimp dish that I did not touch because it had no nuts.\n\nOverpriced.  Poor service.  Waste of time.More"}
{"review":"If you\u2019re ever in the area it\u2019s a must you dine here, the Calamari was amazing!!!! The cocktails are stout, the atmosphere pleasant and the staff was amazing!"}
{"review":"Lovely atmosphere, idyllic setting, excellent service....but mediocre food!  Noting the upscale prices, we were expecting stellar-tasting food.  I like the way I prepare fish at home more than what we experienced at Scott's.  The plating was beautiful but two of the entrees ordered were not...completely eaten.  Having dined all over the world, we realized that the fish and chips were the worst we have ever been served.\nWe wanted to like this place but were saddened to experience an expensive but non-memorable meal.  We will not return and recommend that you find another location to savor at Jack London Square.More"}

The reason I'm leaving a review today If we've just returned from my vacation in Germany and Austria which made us realize not only are we very fortunate with the diversity of culture and culinary here...in the Bay area, but made us appreciate the authenticity of this particular favorite of ours. And of course the beer selection is amazing although I do have one request...\nKonig Ludwig DunkelMore"}

{"review":"A surprise find in Alameda! We ordered the grilled meat platter. While it says it is good for 2-3, it is just enough for 2 (without any additional side dishes).  The assortment of meat was good, highlighted by the smoked pork chop, which was very...tender and flavorful. All the sausages are good and accompanied by two mustards. But the sauerkraut was excellent, especially with the mustard. They should give more on the platter (especially if it is meant for 2-3.  The beer selection was also interesting. Wish they would serve some nice dark rye with the meal.More"}
{"review":"Speisekammer has delicious food and a great selection of beer and a fun atmosphere. You feel like you're back in Germany. Would strongly recommend the weiner schnitzel with the mushroom sauce."}
{"review":"Better than average but less than very good.  The drinks were tasty but might taste the same without alcohol (which means not much of a pour!).  The pretzel was grand, as were the pancakes, and the sausages were good but probably better as an entre....The pork medallions were excellent, but the schweinbraten was quite fatty and didn't enjoy having to be so careful with the meat.  Loved the mashed potatoes and sauerkraut.  Maybe I'm saving not great because German food is not particularly \"gourmet\" or I'm a snob!  The service was attentive and the prices reasonable.More"}

This restaurant is great in the summer as it has outdoor dining. \n\nI was there in January so inside seating for me. And...sadly, no beer as I had a meeting later that evening. \n\nI had Weiner Schnitzel vom Schweine with beats, spetzel and the cucumber mix they serve in vinegar. Great stuff. I had the soup de jour which was potato and leek, I believe. \n\nGood service. I beat the rush by arriving at 5 pm. I was out before 6.

{"review":"This is a really fun and festive place to go with a group!  I wouldn\u2019t say the food was outstanding, but the atmosphere made up for otherwise bland dishes.

{"review":"Decent, but it could improve.\nJust a few notes...\n1- food took a long time to finally make it to the table.\n2- pretzel was very irregular. Some parts were thick and some were very thin (thin as a bread stick)\n3- I ordered the...schnitzel and the potatoes were super soft ( thought they\u2019re supposed to be crispy).\n4- I ordered the spezi drink and asked for a refill and was told that they were out of the gas for the sodas.

Began with a lovely light cucumber\/veggie salad & bread. Huge portions for the main course, I was thrilled with the roasted pork,...sauerkraut & mashed potatoes. All others in our group enjoyed the other entrees and all were enjoyed. Live entertainment (not German;) on a Friday evening.More"}

The menu was pretty big and my only complaint was that the print was...small for my aging eyes. We both ordered Rueben sandwiches. Big error. Maybe the chef was sick that day but the order was almost impossible to bite through. I opened it up and forked over 1\/4 inch slabs of dried up shoe leather that had no taste. The dressing had no taste either. I would have called the manager but we had to run for the ferry.More"}

{"review":"We visited this establishment on April 30, 2002, expecting a good and pleasant dinner. The person who seated us was friendly enough, but it was all downhill from there. We waited a good while for our server, although we were brought water in the meantime....We ordered a glass of chardonnay and a gin & tonic. The chardonnay was very poor, and the G & T was very small and very light on the gin. My wife ordered French onion soup and a \"Caesar salad\"; I ordered sole meuni\u00e8re. She asked if the salad came with bread...the server said no, but he could add a side.  The food came very quickly--microwave quickly it seemed, and was entirely unsatisfactory. The onion soup was ok, but the bread consisted of  two small, tasteless rolls of some kind--this is San Francisco mind you, famous for great sourdough bread! The \"Caesar salad\" was a huge pile of bagged romaine with lots of croutons, and a bit of  flavorless dressing. The \"sole meuni\u00e8re\" was dry, thin, and cold, and unappetizing--laid upon a big blob of mashed potatoes. The best part of the meal was the four or five little slices of zucchini I found under the fish. This was not a cheap meal! About $90 with tip. Just highly disappointing! Anyway, the title of this review says it all. I will avoid this restaurant in the future, and I recommend you do the same!More"}

{"review":"I'm still not sure I know the difference between Mona Lisa #3 on one side of Columbus and Mona Lisa #? on the other.  I'm pretty sure they're the same organization taking advantage of foot traffic\/parking ease on one side of the street vs. the...other.  The Stinking Rose seems to have the same approach.  Both made it through a pandemic in what's certainly a high rent area so more power to them.\n\nThe menu is exactly what you'd expect and hope for in North Beach \/ Little Italy.  We'd specifically chosen Mona Lisa for their gluten free ravioli, not something we run across as a gluten free option very often.  However we were swayed by the gluten free pizza (not unusual option but maybe Mona Lisa could do better than most) and we were not disappointed.  They solved the most glaring fault of most gluten free pizza ... soggy \/ un-crisp crust.  Mona Lisa's was well done throughout.  The toppings were outstanding as expected.  We also had a fine Caprese salad and bruschetta appetizers.  The waiter corrected out pronunciation of pretty much everything ... just what we'd hope for in a Little Italy experience.More"}

Nice 'jumbly' atmosphere and when we went on a Friday night there wasn't a free table - so they're doing something right. \nMy only gripe is that it is...*very* expensive.  We paid just shy of $200 (not including tip) for 2 x spag bol, 2 x ravioli 2 x glasses wine and one slice of gf chocolate cake.More"}
{"review":"Thank you for sharing your review with us! We're happy to hear you enjoyed our gluten-free pasta and atmosphere. We appreciate your support, and hope to see you again!"}
{"review":"Some of the best Italian food! On a girls trip from the east coast. We were recommended by our tour guide. She said this was one of her favorite places. The food, atmosphere and wine were all wonderful. Staff was extremely attentive. They worked extremely...hard to make sure we had a great experience. Would highly recommend!More"}
{"review":"Thank you for your 5-star review! We appreciate your support, and we hope to again if you're ever in the area!"}
{"review":"Hand on heart, I very rarely complain about anything. This was appalling. Yes it was expensive but welcome to San Francisco in 2023 so that was fine but what is wrong and my partner bless him is very passive and wouldn\u2019t let me say anything....However I did I went to the management and he laughed at me and told me to come back tomorrow for a discount. I didn\u2019t wanna discount. I just thought the food main course was appalling, starters and wine were delightful. Wasn\u2019t interested locked me out the door really don\u2019t recommend it \ud83d\ude33More"}
{"review":"Amazing service.  Seated quickly on a busy Saturday evening. The waiter Malek was informative and helped us choose. Would definitely come back 10\/10"}

{"review":"I stopped by this location with my husband as part of a North Beach\/Little Italy culinary Walking Tour. This was the last location. I really like the ambiance and I had a delicious cab. The only reason for the 4 stars is the pizza margarita...was not the best. I will try this place again and order something different. I highly enjoyed the wine.More"}
{"review":"We've reached out to you in a private message to thank you for taking the time to write this review. We look forward to speaking with you more!"}

{"review":"I went here for dinner one evening.  It wasn\u2019t crowded.  The sever was nice.  The decor was interesting.  The pasta was great. Make sure to order the homemade pasta. It\u2019s an option. And it\u2019s great."}
{"review":"We've sent you a private message as a personal thank you for this review. We hope to see you again soon!"}
{"review":"A mess of decorations with statues chained to walls and just a jumble of \u201cstuff\u201d. The staff was nice but they had 5 offerings for salmon and no crab other than crab cakes. A quarter of the ribeye steak was all fat and so good...to Bono\u2019s instead.More"}
{"review":"Great personal friendly service\nLovely food\nGood atmosphere \nThe most delicious orange tiaramissu ever!\nWould definitely recommend visiting if holidaying in San Francisco!"}
{"review":"Kismet! Our parking garage for the big Baseball Game was kitty corner from Marlowe and we decided to gamble and have dinner - pre game. How bad could it  be? We were impressed the minute we walked in - belly-upped to the bar...oh,man....The bar is...so cool...the bartender was a true Mixologist! We were enamored and very happy quaffing couple of drinks pre- dinner. We thought the bar was impressive...as we were seated for dinner and perused the menu - we knew we were in for an experience. Let me say - we happily missed an inning or two as we were so taken with the Scallops, the Grilled Ribeye...All of us happy diners cannot wait to return.More"}
{"review":"Burger was tasty, fries almost inedible with them being so salty. Not sure how I feel value wise. $75 for burger and fries, tempura vegetables and an additional fries with a coke.."}
{"review":"We stopped for a late lunch& early dinner on Saturday,  the menu was short... since dinner starts at 17:00.\nWe all had hamburgers and we all loved them. Great horseradish aioli with a twist. Carrot cake was nice. Cocktails & beer as well.\nService was...excellent.More"}
{"review":"This place was on my list for a long time. Finally came in for lunch. Make a reservation, it gets crowded. The space has plenty of lights coming through the windows, very bistro-like decore.\n\nI started with bubbles and oysters. They only had one option...of shellfish, I would have preferred some options. For lunch I had the steak tartare and a salad. The tartare was good, the toast was too salty. It was a light and satisfying lunch. I\u2019ll have to try one of their sandwiches\/burger next time. The rum punch cocktail was good, not too sweet just right.More"}
{"review":"Marlowe is located on Brannan Street where there\u2019s a lot of foot traffic because of the businesses nearby. Had dinner there on a Thursday and the place was getting packed at around 6. Anyway, we ordered the baked oysters, octopus and squid salad and the...Alaskan salmon . All three dishes were really good.More"}
{"review":"Burrata was good but the bread that came with it was burnt. My pork chop was dry and burnt and drenched in a too sweet sauce. Bread pudding dessert was more like chopped up pieces of bread with some chopped apples on top. Very disappointing."}
{"review":"Marlowe is a restaurant with a cozy glamorous vibe. We went in for dinner, the place was full but you don\u2019t feel overcrowded. The service was also prompt for a full house. \n\nI starts my drink with Breakfast old fashioned, of course it\u2019s a spirit...forward choice but it was done just right. A nice touch to the classic. Then later we went for a bottle of red which is priced very reasonably. \n\nFor food I had the Marlowe burger and brown butter Brussels sprouts for sides. The burger is excellent, the fries was also very nice with it. My friend ordered a steak which received very good comments as well.\n\nOverall great place, great food, friendly services.More"}
{"review":"I went to Marlowe for its high profile  burger which did not disappoint. The secret to the Marlowe burger is 20% ground lamb plus a secret horseradish sauce. It comes with shredded lettuce ,cheddar cheese and bacon -absolutely delicious.Have the Brussels sprout chips to start,...select a couple of glasses from an extensive wine list and finish with coffee and their peanut butter bites served in a jar. Great atmosphere and staff.More"}

{"review":"Beautiful and fresh place, ideal for a lunch or brunch. Fantastic burger and very good cocktails, i took an excellent moscow mule, a bit expensive but absolutely recommended"}
{"review":"Stopped one afternoon on my way to the ball game, glad I did. Had the open faced deviled egg sandwich, basically a super fancy egg salad sandwich, very good. Also had 2 old fashioned\u2019 very tasty. Short walk to the stadium. Trendy. Tasty. Unique menu."}
{"review":"Non descript little spot with an awesome bar\/cocktail experience and great clean food.   Atmosphere is \u201cbusy\u201d with a friendly vibe.  Sunday burger rocks!  You will not be disappointed"}
{"review":"Had brunch here before a Giants home game. The only seating was available at the bar, they were booked for the tables. I had the crab\/shrimp frittata and it was perfect. No complaints with the dish, something I would highly recommend. The bartender also recommended...a greyhound as my brunch drink, and that was tasty too! Great place to have brunch if you\u2019re in the area.More"}
{"review":"I went to Marlowe on a Saturday afternoon on my own. The staff is super friendly, the menu is healthy and delicious and the cocktails and wine selection is awesome. Classy but relaxed...try to jumbo shrimp cocktail...practically a meal into itself!"}
{"review":"Tempted in by the Brussels Sprout chips however the sweet corn soup trumped it.  Polenta with mushrooms got an approving nod from our waitress whilst the pork chop was a great slab of perfection.  However youngest want to proclaim the burger her best ever."}
{"review":"We had to wait but it was worth it, we were sat outside which was good as it was a warm day. This restaurant does not accept tips it is built into the cost which we liked. The service was a little slow as they...were busy and we were outside. I asked for the won ton soup to start but unfortunately it was not available on the day we visited. We went for the duck which was lovely and there was lots of it! We also had the Spicy Beef clay pot which was definitely spicy!More"}
{"review":"Excellent Szechuan kitchen in San Francisco! Very authentic ! We had a great dinner, comparable to our dining experiences in Asia"}
{"review":"Overpriced. Food is good but not extraordinary. The ambiance in the restaurant is old and tired looking. They rest on their laurels of days gone by and outdated Michelin reviews. Lots of other excellent options in Chinatown at more reasonable prices."}
{"review":"Soup we wanted was not available. Chicken soup was water and pieces of chopped chicken. They let us pay 7 USD more\n\nChicken with soy was withou rice or anything 28 usd.\n\nOn top of the bill comes 20 USD additional costs"}
{"review":"GREAT chicken chili! This is the signature dish which we went for. Place was super busy so perhaps limited attentionm but great food :-)"}
{"review":"The food is really very good and deserves an \"Excellent\" score.\nHowever, the infrastructure is not up to that same level"}
{"review":"The food was outstanding! The extensive menu had a variety of dishes, literally for every taste. The service was fast, and since we ended up sharing a table with two other couples, we didn't have to wait to be seated.  Definitely a great choice in...Chinatown!More"}
{"review":"Our hotel recommended the restaurant next door but luckily we noticed the crowd and changed plans! The food was incredibly - I can't stop thinking about the amazing Peking duck, incredible green beans! and bamboo shoots. The tea selection was fabulous and we couldn't recommend...this restaurant more.More"}
{"review":"We've eaten lots of spicy Thai & Indian dishes with great nuanced flavors. \nHowever, one of their signature dishes-- Chicken w\/ Explosive Chili Pepper was a really clumsy attempt that did not appeal to me at all. Just chopped-up dried chili peppers mixed with deep...fried breaded chicken nuggets with absolutely no sauce. Very disappointing. The worst restaurant meal we've ever ordered. We had to order a third meal and were charged for all three.More"}
{"review":"The food is very average at best.  We paid $133 for four meals.  You have to pay for rice separately!  Service is average.  The decor is ran down."}
{"review":"This restaurant was highly recommended by the hotel staff and it was fantastic.  They don't take same day reservations so plan ahead or get there when they open at 5.  It filled up very fast."}
{"review":"It\u2019s no surprise that this restaurant is in the Michelin guide or that former president Obama has eaten here.  We had 2 dishes for 2 people, but  they are huge and we easily could have had 3 people for these 2 dishes.  They were both...magnificent. The main dish which is a house specialty, was the spicy fish boiled in a hot sauce with dozens of chili peppers in the broth.  I\u2019ve had this Szechuan dish elsewhere, however, this was cooked to perfection and the taste was sublime.  The other dish was the eggplant, which was also delicious. We thought the meal was so extraordinary that it was worth the hour long wait in the cold. I would definitely return on my next visit to SF.More"}
{"review":"The food was good and plentiful.I thought it was a bit expensive, but San Francisco IS expensive.\nWe had a group of 10 or 12 and they accommodated us quickly (reservations).Very nice servers."}
{"review":"In the heart of San Francisco's Chinatown the Z and Y is famous with all the locals, and infamous for the many celebrities that have partaken of their exquisite Szechuan cooking. \n\n Unassuming ambiance, almost always full (reservations only for parties greater than 2 persons only),...and a bustling take out service, this is THE PLACE for locals and visitors; and it does not disappoint. In fact: it DELIVERS big time.\n\nWe went  early on a Monday to be sure we could be seated....and more specifically for the Peking Duck. From the looks of the tables around us just about everything on the menu gets a full work out. The variety is impressive. The smells and looks even more so. \n\nOur duck (takes a few extra minutes to prepare) was done to perfection. Crackly skin, tender slices of seasoned, sumptuous,duck, the sweet bean sauce, the cukes the scallions, and the paper thin pancakes all together: a food coma in waiting. With either an ice cold chinese beer or glass of wine: stunning.\n\nWe started with several soup dumplings in a vibrant vinegar sauce...delicious and enough to set the stage for the duck en route.\n\nThe menu is in a book with pictures:  extensive from the flaming clay pots to wonton soup, from spicy octopus to frog with spicy chili, braised ox tail, mongolian beef, twice cooked pork, stir fry chinese cabbage....it's all there and then some.\n\nService is by committee and every server knowledgable about the food, how to order and how to eat. With a smile.\nPrices are China Town affordable. The portions oft require a take home box.\nParking around the area is a bit sparce. Taking a cab or uber\/lyft is probably the easiest  way to arrive and depart. It's not far from the wharf or downtown. \nHowever you get there....it's worth it!\nLunch and dinner times vary a bit, best  to go on the web site and\/or call.More"}
{"review":"Great restaurant in China Town.  I ordered the Tan Tan noodles and they were spicy but delicious.  My son ordered the egg fried rice and it was amazing.  My husband ordered fish in chili oil.  Everything was delicious.  We would definitely recommend this restaurant!"}
{"review":"What a treat.  I've never been to China, but my context clues tell me that this must be authentic Chinese cuisine: Menus are completely in Chinese and laminated.  They give you a Sharpie so you can just circle the picture.  Lots of Chinese speaking patrons...and wait staff.  Hot tea and egg-drop soup were served at no charge.  I had Black Pepper beef, and it was scrumptious.  Great prices, too.More"}
{"review":"Went early before 10:30am on a Saturday. Restaurant filled up soon after. Good variety of dim sum. Pretty standard fare. Flavors are good and so is service."}
{"review":"East Ocean is such a wonderful place and friendly environment to visit with the family. Their unique Hong Kong-style food offerings and dim sum specialties are so fresh, authentic and delicious! I LOVE the new sushi menu- super fresh, savory and creative.. this is our...favorite restaurant in the Bay Area and we go as often as possible!! But last night, we ordered in and had a fancy dinner at home :)More"}
{"review":"This is a hidden gem! I drove from Berkeley to Alameda just to try it out and now I am hooked!\nall the dimsum items are super fresh, hand made and not overly seasoned. I plan to come back as often as possible. try their...FOOK YUEN fried rice!More"}
{"review":"We have been here many times for dinner, but mostly for weekend Dim Sum. This month for our nephews 18th birthday. As always it did not disappoint. Excellent food,good variety and friendly service! And a complimentary birthday mango pudding with a birthday candle! Be ready...for a wait if you go at peak dim sum hours.More"}
{"review":"The more people the more dishes you can share. Always a great sign when you see people of Chinese heritage in a Chinese restaurant as who is the best judge? Excellent dim sum as well as other dishes into dinner as well. They are also...generous supporters of local non-profits, generosity as well.More"}
{"review":"It\u2019s a must for me to visit this restaurant whenever I\u2019m in town! From the gorgeous view to the wonderful dim sum dishes, this place is amazing!!!"}
{"review":"We had always wanted a real dim sum experience and now we've done it.  Got to East Ocean Seafood at about 10:30 on a Sunday morning, thinking they opened at 11.  They were already nearly full, but we were ushered right to a table and...had five plates of different items in front of us within a matter of minutes.  All of the dishes were good, although there is a learning curve to figure out personal favorites.  Having a sweet tooth, one of my favorites was the sugar doughnut, which is an amazing gossamer creation of sugar and fat.  And it was one of the least expensive meals we ate in the Bay area.More"}
{"review":"We used to go to Oakland Chinatown for dim sum but dim sum restaurants seem to have gone by the wayside.  A friend suggested we try East Ocean in Alameda.  We were pleasantly surprised and delighted by the extensive menu variety, food preparation, and food...quality.  Prices are reasonable.  It gets crowded on weekends; weekdays are much better.More"}
{"review":"I\u2019ve eaten here several times when visiting family in the Bay Area. The dim sum is so fine, and though I don\u2019t eat pork or beef, there are plenty dishes to choose from.My granddaughter just loves the plain shrimp dim sum, but my favorite is...the one with cilantro added.More"}
{"review":"parking is an issue for large parties, there are no adequate parking, But surrounding area had a vacant lot with pay parking, You have to walk a bit with your shoes and heels in order to reach the restaurant, I suggest to drop off your...group and let the driver walk 2 blocks, food is great, really fine dining, went there many times, will come back again.More"}
{"review":"Came here instead of driving all the way to SF. There was a little bit of wait because the pkace was so packed. We came for dimsumb&!i love their siomai: very tasty & size is a little bit bigger than the restaurant i go to...in SF. Chicken feet was so good, a little spicy. Shrimp dumpling was so-so but dont get the pirk & shrimp dumpling coz it\u2019s oily. Sesame\nBalls were big & very delicious. I dont eat durian but upon reading other\u2019s reviews i guess i had to try their pastry... it was sooo good, both the pastry & the durian w\/c was a creamy delight. But my favorite was the green ball dessert with yellow filling, i believe it\u2019s mochi. Service was good & i really enjoyed our mealMore"}
{"review":"This is our family\u2019s go to restaurant if we\u2019re celebrating some kind of occasion.  The food is so delicious here and there is a large choice constantly circling on the carts.  You can also order off the menu which is equally delicious!  I believe Dim...Sum is only served at lunch time and menu ordering at dinner.  This is definitely a must eat at when in the Bay Area.More"}
{"review":"Dear Bobnator,\n\nThank you so much for visiting our restaurant. Comments like yours make us thrive to provide the very best to our customers. \nWe do have a limited list of dim sum during the dinner hours.\nWe look forward to your return!"}
{"review":"Great service &fresh,  tasty food. Liked the lazy Susan in the middle of the table so we could share!"}
{"review":"Great everything, from service to food. This spot is way better than some joints in Oakland, Chinatown."}
{"review":"Everything about our experience was sublime. The view was, without exception, the best view of our entire trip. Our waiter was incredible. The cocktails and drinks scrumptious and our meals were just so delicious. So very glad we booked. It was a late lunch, around...1.30, so maybe that\u2019s a good time. Not too busy. A super bonus was being able to see the pelicans come in to land on the roof. We have raved about this place near and wide. Could not recommend this more highly. \nIf you are ever in Sausalito, this is THE place I would book. If I could, I would be back in a heartbeat but we live in New Zealand and that was a trip of a lifetime for us!More"}
{"review":"Had a nice lunch here.  Was fortunate to get outside table with nice views.  Opted for soup and salad.  Both were very tasty and on pint.  Service was okay."}
{"review":"Fabulous location on the water, fortunate enough to get a window table with uninterrupted view across the bay to San Fran. Food and service outstanding."}
{"review":"Spectacular view across the Bay and back at Sausalito. The service was friendly and efficient. I enjoyed the Pan Seared Scallops for lunch. Such a variety of flavors and textures, including butternut squash, asparagus, and whole cloves of garlic aplenty. Afterwards we treated ourselves to...gelato and sorbet. A thoroughly enjoyable experience.More"}
{"review":"Overprices. Slow service. mediocre dishes and overall disappointment. Waited a half an hour from seating to getting a waiter. Drinks took 20 minutes more and food was so so."}
{"review":"Had lunch on a weekday. We came earlier, shortly after opening, and got a window table. By the time we were leaving, this place was full. Reservation recommended, although they accommodate the walk-ins. Usually you get great views or great food, not both, and it's...true for this place. We had great views and some entertainment from the sea creatures and birds, also lots of sails to watch. The food was between ok and good.More"}
{"review":"We recently had our wedding reception here and what a wonderful time we had. The staff was so friendly and helpful. They were on top of things the entire event. Jeff and his gang are the best. And the food was amazing too!"}
{"review":"The service at Spinnaker is amazing, they were kind and also were helpful. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone who is looking for a good view during dinner and also looking for some tasty seafood."}
{"review":"Our tour guide recommended here for lunch and the view. The view was amazing. We thought the clam chowder was delicious and the creamiest we had every had. We both enjoyed our seafood lunch selections and had good service. We might not make it here...again (live half way across the country), but if we did, we would go back.More"}
{"review":"Very good views.  Good Angel Hair with Shrimp and Scallop.  Very average fried fish platter.  Shrimp were underdone; scallops tiny (about the size of a pencil eraser).  Platter had one shrimp; four \"slivers\" of scallop (that may have totaled one medium scallop); decent helping of...calamari (but ordinary taste); and one piece of fish hidden in a mass of batter.  Fries arrived cool (room temperature).  \n\nWaiters must be trained to frown -- not a single one ever showed anything else.  Waitress working table next to us brought out two tables' food at the same time.  Second table had 9 guests ... 4 served from the left, 2 from the right, and 3 had their plates handed to them.  She made it easy for herself and didn't seem to care where the plates landed.More"}
{"review":"Bad food,  tired building and staff, over cooked and over priced. I honestly don\u2019t know how old those reviews are but I based my choice on them. Don\u2019t do it. I had the sole which was completely overcooked. My partner had the sailors plate. Should...have named it sailors fate. Everything was covered in the thickest \u2018batter\u2019 of crumbs and deep fried. Both dishes were oily and overcooked. I always look at other good dishes being brought out and they all looked awful. On the bright side the setting is amazing. It\u2019s such a pityMore"}
{"review":"Excellent food service and fantastic location \nIt was the 3rd visit and alway recommend it to any friends visiting San Francisco \nA wonderful experience"}
{"review":"The Spinnaker was chosen because of its marvelous view of San Francisco across the Bay.  But you can't eat the view.  The food was merely OK.  The \"service\" was HORRIBLE.  What should have been a 2-hour dinner stretched to 3 because the waitress would disappear...for long periods of time between courses.  For the expense, the food isn't worth it.More"}
{"review":"We symboled upon the Spinnaker 7 months ago, figured it might be a tourist trap: decent food with a nice view. We couldn\u2019t have been more wrong!\n\nSo we came back, and the food is exceptional again!  My guy had the special Chilean sea bass...with a lobster risotto - unbelievable. I enjoyed the absolute best bouillabaisse I\u2019ve ever had, and believe me, I love my boulliabaisse!  \n\nThis is an absolute do not miss if you love exceptional food.  Oh, and the views are AMAZING as well.  But come for the food!More"}
{"review":"Seated outside on a beautiful Saturday afternoon. Great views of san Francisco and the bay. Busser delivered Bread\/butter & waters immediately. Server arrived in a reasonable timeframe and explained the soup and daily specials. opted to start with calamari and then the crab cakes\/chowder combo...and the avocado, shrimp, crab clubhouse. \n\nCalamari was cooked perfectly, nice and tender. Chowder had a perfect balance of clam meat to potato but otherwise was a bit bland tasting. As noted by some others, the crab cakes are small, but packed with crab - no filler - and very tasty! The clubhouse was excellent with plenty of shrimp and crab, just enough mayo and fresh tomato and avocado on perfectly toasted bread,  it was a hit!\n\nService was very good. Friendly and efficient so no complaints there. \n\nA bit pricey yes, but location, location, location. Would certainly be back.More"}
{"review":"This is a great place to visit with lots of stuff to gawk at and enjoy.  The staff was very friendly and we enjoyed a wide variety of dishes.   Great food!"}
{"review":"Visited for drinks and sat in the outside seating area. Lovely drinks and the staff were friendly and attentive. Nice little spot to enjoy the sunshine."}
{"review":"Tour guide recommended Stinking Rose to our group.  We decided to take him up on it.  We're really glad we did.  I got the pasta bolognese, which was excellent.  Wife got a garlic brie chicken and mushrooms; it was likewise superb.  Waiter, Pablo, was attentive...and knowledgeable.   Would definitely go back!More"}
{"review":"A friend suggested the Stinking Rose to me when I visited San Francisco 16 years ago. I remember it as a FANTASTIC!!!! experience.  16 years later, on a trip with my daughter, I wanted to take her to the same restaurant.   We were seated quickly...(had a reservation), given water and waited quite some time to be greeted by our waiter. He was pleasant when he did come for our order.  We started with the garlic skillet appetizer (have purposefully blocked the name from my mind).  It tasted too strongly of anchovies, the garlic was just mush and it was beyond oily.  Overall, so unpleasant we couldn\u2019t eat more than a few bites.  I ordered a lasagna calzone and my daughter ordered the 40 clove chicken. Her chicken was so undercooked that when she cut into it it oozed blood.  She cut into in a few other spots and it was indeed undercooked.  The waiter offered to \u201cheat it up a bit more\u201d and she passed easily.  I did not recognize the shape of my lasagna calzone (have had many and none were the same strange shape), parts of it were burnt and when I cut into it I found only some cheese. It was meant to have a bolognese sauce and sausage along with that cheese.  This ended up being only the second time in my life where I got up and left a restaurant.  The other time was due to waiting an hour for an iced tea and to order. This was the first time I left because of the food.   This whole experience was beyond disappointing. It\u2019s such a shame this restaurant went so downhill over the years.More"}
{"review":"The name refers to a Roman reference to garlic. I love it, and they use it. Not to overpower, but certainly to celebrate. I had a chicken mushroom linguini, with the pasta obviously hand-made. When presented it looked sparse, but girl, it was everything a...traveling 152 pound white man needed. Base your appetizer and desert choices from there.More"}
{"review":"We didn\u2019t book and it as really busy but as we went quite late we got a table. \n\nBoth dishes were nice. I had the crab al fredo which was nice but portion was smaller than expected. \n\nService was good and food came out quickly....Nice decor.More"}
{"review":"Great food but man was it loud in there couldn\u2019t enjoy the meal as the manager \/ owner was shouting at some friends everybody trying to outdo each other phew \ud83d\ude05"}
{"review":"The restaurant was almost empty, but the service was very slow.  The sandwiches we had (bacon, crab) were just ok.  When my son asked for some lettuce on his hamburger, they charged an extra $2 for two small pieces of lettuce.  And there was no...taste of garlic in our sandwiches, even though it was supposed to, according to the menu.More"}
{"review":"Went to The Stinking Rose and sat at the bar. Ordered an apetitiser and entree. Within 10 mins of the appetiser coming out our entr\u00e9e arrived. We hadn\u2019t finished the appetiser. We ordered rib eye steak medium. The steak was charcoaled on the outside and...as we cut into the middle it was rare. Only when we put our napkins on the plate the staff member asked if we wanted it cooked more. This place treats its customers like a conveyor belt - they just want you in and then out - avoid!!!More"}
{"review":"Twenty-odd years after our first visit we thought a return trip was in order!  The atmosphere was buzzy and fun, and the food and service were great, especially the garlic ice cream!  It was expensive though, coming in at $140 incl tax and service.  \n\nOverall,...well worth a visit, but I\u2019m not sure  we\u2019ll be back for a third time.More"}
{"review":"We popped in here for a pizza on our last day in SF. We chose a table outside which had heaters and it was lovely. We sat and watched the world go by on busy Columbus Avenue. The food was lovely and the staff were...friendly, polite and attentive. Well worth a visit.More"}
{"review":"The Stinking Rose, a famous Italian restaurant  known for its use of garlic, has a new location on Columbus Avenue where Calzone Restaurant used to be. \n\nThere is outdoor and indoor seating. I opted for the outdoor seating -  great for people watching. I had...a panini with a beer. The panini was average. Maybe I will try pasta another time.More"}
{"review":"We experienced their great wine selection and service.  Ambience was wonderful!  The menu almost talked us into an early dinner, but we'll be back for dinner next time!"}
{"review":"A thoroughly enjoyable meal with excellent table service. Couldn\u2019t fault anything. The attention to details was particularly good; water was constantly topped up and, despite it being a very busy evening, their standards didn\u2019t slip."}
{"review":"Came here solo for lunch.  Did not have a reservation but they asked if I wanted inside or not.  There was another solo diner outside so I opted for that as it was a beautiful cool but sunny day.  I was a bit worried as...there wasn't a whole lot of sidewalk but it was perfect and the people watching was great!  Highly, highly recommend the Garlic Fennel Sausage (with extra garlic LOL).  The crust was light, the finely chopped red onion and garlic was perfect and the sausage took it over the top!  I ate the entire thing by myself!  The staff were very kind, always refilling water and checking on me.More"}
{"review":"Dine outside in the cozy patio. Great food and service. Pasta was delicious and all dishes served at the same time and hot."}
{"review":"Really nice food. Very hot and fresh and really friendly service. A great quick bite to eat in a very convenient location"}
{"review":"We came because we saw many favorable reviews, and once again, they told the truth.  We actually walked all the way from the financial district to this place (some kind of hike), and when we got here, we loved the look and the charm of...the establishment. \n\nThe food fell right into line with what we read and what we could see with our eyes.  We shared two entrees and both were delish.  And, we had an amazing server that took good care to point out the level of spice in a dish we were considering (and eventually chose) and that kind of care is really appreciated.  \n\nSo, if you want charm and good food, try this place.  You will be well rewarded.  Dinner for two, including three drinks, two salads and two entrees was $132 before tip.  An excellent value.More"}
{"review":"Found this gem while searching in SF for a brunch spot after a hike along the coast.  We were seated quickly at a quaint table surrounded by citrus trees in containers.  One of our group is vegan and although there's not a dedicated vegan dish,...she was able to order a nice salad.  The waiter was super sweet and brought out a beet salad as a curtesy - which was delicious.   Between the 4 of us, we ordered chicken sandwich (delicious!), potato hash (my daughter's first experience with poached eggs) (again delicious) and a salad.  We also ordered garlic fried potatoes - not French fries, but potato chunks fried perfectly with garlic and herbs.   We will definitely return and remember this place!More"}
{"review":"We stopped by for a late dinner. The house-made spaghetti with pancetta and brussels sprouts was very good. The wood-fired Margherita pizza was also good. Service was prompt and the atmosphere homey. I would recommend Rose\u2019s for a nice dinner."}

{"review":"We ended up here because it was a Monday and this was one of the few on our list that was open. The food was good, although it would have been nice if there were more lunch selections and maybe something seasonal. I had the...polenta (really good) with sausage (dry) and poached eggs. Service was good...first cup of coffee was cold but replaced quickly. This is a solid neighborhood place, just Not someplace I would recommend for a special lunch.More"}

{"review":"Maru Sushi is on Powell Street, along the Powell-Hyde cable car line on the south side of Nob Hill, just a few blocks up from Union Square. It is a modest and pleasant-looking restaurant, with friendly service and excellent sushi. We had a California roll...and a Spicy Tuna Roll on the lunch special ($16), and the Swamp ($16.50), which despite its unappetizing name was very tasty. Many other items are available. A cup of Jasmine tea was a bit steep at $4 (a pot of loose tea for two would have been more economical). Overall it was a good lunch experience.More"}

Believe it or not the following day we came back because it was simply irresistible. my husband doesn\u2019t like sushi but after this...trip he\u2019s a fan. To enjoy the experience sit at the bar not the table. Seeing the chefs making the food informs of your eyes at that speed is incredible. All my respect!More"}

The owner and our waitress were so kind and friendly to our family....I love the decor and theme of the restaurant, it made the place extra special IMO. If we were local we\u2019d definitely come back with out the kids. They have a nice set up where you can sit out doors. I took a pic of the sign but it made me laugh and relieved they took Public health seriously.More"}

{"review":"Having lived in Oakland for 50 years, I visited Jack London Square often... and even working there for a short period.   The fat lady has always been a favorite, but I never thought about sitting down and writing a review.   This is the time.  It...was date night and we enjoyed a martini at the bar, our reservation came up and we were sat at a comfortable table.  \nI ordered my favorite... the pork chop.  Ah, what a beauty!  Thick, cooked perfectly (I've had them at Emeril's in New Orleans, I know) with a nice apple finish.  My lady ordered the Halibut, a special that night...and it was great.  We shared.\nThe Fat Lady decorates for the season or holiday and it's always fun to see what they come up with to enjoy.  Don't miss it, it's an Oakland treasure!More"}
{"review":"Met family and dined here last week.  There were nine of us, which was a bit hard to accomodate, but they made it happen.  This is an old bordello that Jack London frequented.  The place is decorated in a very ecclectic fashion.  The food was...very good and the service also.  If you are in the mood for something different and out of the ordinary stop by and grab a good meal.More"}
{"review":"We have dined here many times! The decor is quite outlandish which is what makes it so much fun! The food has always been exceptional, there is a great wine list and the service is wonderful. The last time we started with the pate which...was outstanding. We then split a goat cheese and roasted tomato salad, had excellent entrees and finished with a decadent dessert. We had a nice Napa Valley Sauvignon Blanc.More"}

{"review":"Kind of a different spot, with some pretty cool (strange?) decor. Very good vibe, awesome service and the food is really good. Steak was on point, cooked and seasoned perfectly."}
{"review":"The minute you walk into this eclectic restaurant,  the atmosphere enthralled us. The skirt steak, crab cake,  and the mushroom faro soup was a delicious lunch. The art work from ceiling, walls, and decoration- seasonal (Halloween,  Christmas,  and New Years are not to be missed....And the hot buttered rum cocktail was just the best start to our trip.More"}
{"review":"Maybe because we've always gone at off-prime times, it's never been as crowded or as loud as you might expect.  Never had trouble hearing my companions, and the meals are as good as the menu sounds.  So it's a good spot for a friendly get-together...-- or a romantic one.  The decor took me a minute to appreciate, and then I really did.  It's fun, with great food and service.More"}

{"review":"Very courteous and quick service. A large array of meat and fish to suit any pallet. You start with the base of many different types of broth, including vegetarian availability. Then you select proteins,vegetables, noodles and other  accompaniments for each added cost. There are always...leftovers. Very tasty and healthy.  I got one of the lamb with the half original half spicy soup together with the homemade noodles. I did the spicy beef tendon, although listed as an appetizer came actually towards the end of the meal, but was exceptionally tasty and not very spicy. I liked having the two flavors because bocChoy and Lamb to me tasted better with the original to bring out the natural flavors and I did the noodles in the spicy. I had the dessert it was also a nice touch at the end.   looking at others\n Tables a big selection of vegetables and mushrooms and types of tofu fish meat makes this a very fun experience as well as tasty.  easily can spend $50 or more each but considering cist elsewhere in the city it was well worth the price.More"}
{"review":"The attraction of this place is as much the experience as the food. I had the chef\u2019s choice of broth (half plain bone broth which is very tasty, and half spicy bone broth, also delicious). Given that I was only 1 person, I couldn\u2019t get...too much of a variety, but the fish was the best, so tender and tasty in either broth. The pumpkin was best in the spicy broth and the cabbage in either. Although they recommend the Napa cabbage, I wouldn\u2019t get that again. Too stringy. I would probably get bok choy. I took a photo of my neighbors\u2019 table because there were so many things. Best to come here with at least 2 people.More"}
{"review":"Ever since my friend from China introduced me to hot pot in college, I have been obsessed with it. Every time I go on vacation, I search for a hot pot restaurant as we have none local to us. We picked this one, because it...was the closest to our hotel, and we were pleased with the results. The table we had only had one burner, so I was happy to see that they had a split pot, as I can no longer eat spicy foods, but my husband still loves it. We ordered quite the spread and weren't able to eat all of it. The broth was delicious, and my husband and I walked out fat and happy. The restaurant itself is up some stairs, and a little tight feeling, but we had a seat next to the window, so it didn't feel crowded at all for us. The food came out quickly, and the waitstaff was friendly. If we come to San Francisco again, I'd eat here again.More"}
{"review":"The food was amazing ! Very fresh vegetables and leat. Service is efficient and fear. They adviced us well on the quantity to order. Follow their recommandation in the plates to choose (mushroom, meat,...). First experience of a Mongolian food, look foward trying it again."}
{"review":"The hot pot was superb. The problem was a) finding this tiny place; and b) navigating the tables, which were too closely placed.  Do try all of the meats and seafoods. Beware of the draft beer.  It has a big punch to it."}
{"review":"We have been traveling overseas for two weeks. We visited Edinburgh, Oxford, Cotswold in Uk and Yosemite, Berkeley and San Francisco in California USA.  This little sheep hot pot restaurant provides the similar taste we have in home town of Taiwan. Great place for visitors...who miss the food of home townMore"}
{"review":"This was my first experience with hot pot but won\u2019t be my last.  Unfortunately we were six crowded into a booth and not everyone was comfortable.  But the experience was illuminating.  Two vast pots of boiling broth were placed on the table, then the items...we ordered were brought out on large platters. Thinly shaved lamb, seafood, mushrooms, Napa cabbage and more. Like fondue, one dips their morsel into the pot and then into sauces on the side.  House pulled udon noodles steam throughout the meal and can be slurped up at the end. Can\u2019t wait to do this again.  It would be fun to do at home with a hot pot party.More"}
{"review":"Was not sure what to expect but I was not disappointed.  Excellent food, great ambience and value for money!"}
{"review":"Wow, we were really blown away at how awesome the food was.  We initially had some reservations when we first came in, the fragrance of the food was very strong.  But we saw a lot of other Asians there, so we figured it must be...good.\n\nOrdering was initially confusing, since they give you a sheet with the ingredients that you can put into the hot pot.  You first need to choose the soup type, in our case we went with the half spicy and half original.  Then you choose the quantity of each ingredient.  We were told each ingredient was roughly 4 oz, but I think it's actually one quantity is equal to one pot full.  So if you order two meats, you'll get two \"servings\" of raw, thinly sliced meat to put into your pot.  Our initial order, the waiter suggested 10 - 12 quantity for two adults and two kids (ages 11 and 10).  We ordered too much (had about 15 quantity), and he suggested that we marked down the quantity on some of the meats on our order, and that we could always order more during the meal.\n\nThe meal was fantastic.  The broth and food combined made an amazing experience, my wife and I couldn't get enough.\n\nSeriously, this place needs to be on your list.  Use the Yelp waiting list to get in line, when we arrived the wait list was 45 minutes long, but we were able to get seated in about 10 minutes after arriving.More"}

We had no idea it\u2019s world renowned restaurant for roasted indigenous crab.    Absolutely spectacular, and justifies the high...price.  Don\u2019t pass other crab puffs and plum wine pairs perfectly!  Last but not lest, the derived is just as world class.  Highly recommend gem hidden in the streets of the Outer Sunset District in downtown San Francisco.More"}

{"review":"Ask for the special home crab prepared with garlic en black pepper and a few secret spices more. Best ever!Not cheap but worth it!"}
{"review":"A treat to experience their crabs and other sea foods. Good food and great service. My only surprise was the check.  I forgot to ask \u201cmarket price\u201d before we all ordered. It\u2019s all good but also expensive."}
{"review":"When you walk in you will see everyone wearing bibs during crab season.  This is what you come here for and nothing else.  We tried the sea bass and also ordered the 'obligatory' garlic noodles but basically you are paying $12 for overcooked, too soft...cheap noodles drowned in garlic infused oil.  I don't understand why people are raving about it.  Service is fast (probably too fast) and the crab we ordered arrived in less than 5 minutes, cooked.  Which means because of the high volume they have a lot already waiting and cooked and just need a warm up.  Not sure how I feel about that, but the crab was tasty and satisfying.  Skip everything else so if you are hungry just order 2 crabs cooked in 2 different sauces instead.More"}

{"review":"Took my wife there for the first time, although I\u2019ve been there before.  I always choose their signature roasted peppered crab, egg plant and garlic noodles.  A bit pricey, but worth it when you come from a state where fresh seafood is nonexistent. At $59\/crab,...you better savor every nook and cranny of the crab and know how to do so!  My bill for 2 was roughly $200 before tip, but with a nice bottle of wine.  My advice.... bring your own wine for an appropriate pairing and pay the corkage fee.  Very good customer service.  Stop complaining about the parking.  Valet is cheap compared to parking in downtown SF.More"}

They are very clean and have wiped  down clean tables,every time You finish half of your water they refill it. And they give you one towels to clean your hands, and you have your own waitress that helps you with everything you need which is kind,Have really nice appetizers and if I had a choice of choosing one through 10 I would choose 100 through which doesn\u2019t make sense but it is such a great restaurant and it\u2019s even my first time here and I already love it!There desserts are so pretty and good tasting and I wanna come here every single dinner now.\ud83d\ude0b\ud83d\ude0b\ud83d\ude0bMore"}
{"review":"Some of us have eaten here years before and some of us had it for the first time.  The five of us ordered the roast crab dinner, garlic noodles, and seasonal vegetable saut\u00e9.  A non-crab friend ordered a red snapper dish.  The crab dinner and...garlic noodles were definitely savored.  The garlic noodle that came with the fish dish tasted best and the friend wished he had ordered just the garlic noodles.  The vegetable saut\u00e9, which was also served as part of the fish dish, was left to be desired.  Service was decent and parking was too expensive.  If you love crab and have never been there, do order the roast crab dinner and garlic noodles!More"}

{"review":"What a disappointment! At the recommendation of my sister who lives on Austin, I went in anticipation of having a spot on Dungeness crab dinner. \nThis out of the way nondescript restaurant was filling up quickly at 7PM.\nUnfortunately, the customers didn't know they were...getting screwed by paying top notch prices for \"fresh frozen\" crab. The quality is sooo far inferior  to fresh killed crab. It's masked or should I say sitting in loads of untasty vegetable oil. Rather than having the snowy white flaky meat, it was grayish and not even close.\nThe crabs were large and way overpriced ($59).\nThe 'crispy' vegetable rolls were crispy, heavy and a waste of calories, money and stomach space. \nTo add insult to injury parking is $14 and if you don't want to wait an extended amount of time for retrieval you can pay $20 and the car will be waiting close by. \nA side dish recommended by our waiter was garlic noodles. It was passable.\nThere is no comparison to 'live' Dungeness!\nNeedless to say I  will not be returning  and don't recommend this place.More"}
{"review":"The best Crab dinner EVER!!! the garlic whole crab was amazing, we ordered one large crab for the two of us along with the garlic noodles and 4 BBQ shrimp, we finished the entire meal.

The garlic butter was really good.  \nRoyal tiger prawns - I thought it was okay.  Came on a full order sized...bed of garlic noodles.  Prawns (4) were grilled nicely.  \nGarlic noodles - we ordered this because I did not know the tiger prawns came with a full sized order of noodles.  Noodles were amazing as usual.  A bit sweeter than I would have liked.\nSpicy eggplant - I liked it.  However, also a bit sweeter than I would have preferred.\n\nStreet parking.  People were just double parked outside on the side streets.  We came on a saturday night and it was extremely loud.  Groups of diners were still being seated  5 minutes before closing. Service was fine, nothing special.  Overall, we thought pretty good, but a bit overpriced.More"}
{"review":"I have mixed feelings about ihop in San Francisco. We visited twice whilst on holiday and the two visits varied drastically in service and experience. The first visit was an enjoyable visit. The burger and chips lunch was lovely and the service was quick and...attentive. The second evening visit for pancakes and a milkshake was very disappointing indeed! Only one member of staff front of house working, a long wait for order to be taken\/and the food to arrive! No milkshakes because they had run out of milk!! Customers were jumping the queue and a homeless person was sitting inside the restaurant waiting for scraps which was very off putting! Wouldn't recommend visiting here on an evening as it was probably a regular occurance here.More"}

My business companions had a 2 item combo with Fish tacos, one had a burrito, and I...had a one item combo with a pork enchilada and bought a Chile relleno a la carte.  Food was pretty good.  Fish tacos looked good, combo comes with rice and beans.  Burrito was pretty large (though it looked like it was mostly rice) and my companion was very satisfied.  The pork enchilada was rich and tasty.  Thought the rice was kinda tasteless.  The chili relleno was also huge.  I'd go againMore"}

The flavor was tasty, but I do not like a pure oil texture.\n\nChips and salsa were very tasty,...although the salsa bar was a bit of a mess. \n\nThe dining room is reasonably clean and comfortable. \n\nThey need to put a little bit more effort into the bathroom. Check out the photo I posted of the bathroom door. at a restaurant located in such a premier spot, there is no reason why the bathroom door should look like something from a 1930s train station. It's filthy in the paint is coming off.More"}

{"review":"I landed up going to Tropisueno on a Sunday afternoon, around 3:15 pm, out of desperation.  I was starved and had a limited window in which to eat a fulfilling meal before some major activities scheduled in the evening.  Tropisueno was the only restaurant in...the Yerba Bueno corridor that was still serving food at that hour.  Given that it received a high TripAdvisor rating, I thought it was a safe bet.  Besides, I was starved and desperate.  I do not know how this restaurant has received such high ratings.  It is absolutely awful.  It makes you hate Mexican food.  I selected the chicken mole, with rice and beans.  The only ingredient was salt.  The portion was small (which was fortuitous as you didn't want to eat more than necessary).  All I can say, is that I didn't get sick. But I regret that I just didn't forego a meal for a protein bar instead.More"}

As long as you aren't saving those tables for a long time, they're ok w\/that, groups are there quite often, especially over the holidays.

The food was very good though I can\u2019t...say it\u2019s the best Thai food ever had. Service was wast. The place looks pretty clean. My only complaint is that they had the menu posted on the window with dish prices including rice. When I get inside, the waiter says rice is not included. That was a little upset for me but I was hungry and ended staying there to have dinner. Another thing that surprised me was that the Pad Thai was served with glass noodles when normally it\u2019s served with flat rice noodles. In conclusion, it is as very good but not including a side of rice with their dishes doesn\u2019t look right to me.More"}
{"review":"I introduced my mom to Thai food a few years ago. Now every time we travel together, we try to find a Thai restaurant. This establishment was a block away from our hotel so we decided to give it a try. We are glad we...did. \nMy mom always orders Pad Thai, so I made her order something different. We got the eggplant dish with pork and it was delicious. We ordered Larb and when asked how spicy we wanted it we decided on medium, but that was too hot. I like a little burn that makes my lips tingle (I'm kind of a weenie). It was still delicious, but I should have ordered mild.\nFinally, we asked about desserts. The waiter was very patient and kind when answering our questions. We ordered the roti with taro ice cream. I asked about it because the ice cream was purple and it intrigued me. That was the best decision of the night. That taro ice cream was AMAZING and to roti was flaky and delicious. It was a perfect way to end a great meal. \nWe went about four in the afternoon. We were the only seated customers, but there was a steady stream of takeout orders being picked up. Service was friendly and fast. I would definitely recommend this to anyone seeking good Thai food.More"}

{"review":"Our first night in San Francisco so we decided to take a little walk from Union Squire and we came across this lovely little restaurant one block away.

There were 4 of us & we shared!We had 3 specialty rolls - Hidden Agenda, Prime Suspect and Missing Piece (hard to chose a favourite)! We also had tomato...Nigari (which was especially good with a slither of ginger)! Also had Karage and Edame - yum! \nBoys enjoyed their beers and cocktails were delicious! I have not eaten at a vegan restaurant before and absolutely loved this dining experience!!! Highly recommended!!More"}
{"review":"We had another great modern vegan Japanese meal at Shizen and were super satisfied with everything --- some of the best food you're going to get, plated beautifully and in a lovely setting --- except the service which was mostly indifferent and a little rude....Unfortunately, that taints the otherwise wonderful experience and I'm a little less enthused to return.More"}
{"review":"The service was really nice, but the food was sooooo expensive and underwhelming.  So many places are so hyped here, trendy, \"exclusive,\" and so many are stupid disappointments.  This is one of those.  I guess we're supposed to be grateful that there's any vegan sushi...restaurant at all?More"}
{"review":"If you are in the Bay Area and you love sushi, this place should be on your list! They have so many nice sushi rolls, with many vegan sauces to go along with it! All of the sushi was nicely decorated, so you can tell...the chef values having his dishes come out looking the best he can. If you like taking photos of your good, all the dishes are Instagramable.  \n\nWe had to make a reservation in advance cause this place tends to get crowded, especially on the weekends. The service was excellent and we couldn\u2019t be happier! \n\nTotally recommend to vegan lovers out there!More"}
{"review":"I was looking forward to this place as soon as I heard about it when planning my roadtrip in California.  It did not disappoint!  It was innovative, fresh, and delicious!   I went with my niece and we got 3 rolls.  The California roll, Sweet Potato...Roll, and Surprise Ending.  All 3 were delicious!  I can't choose which I liked best.  The Surprise ending was also fun.  It's 6 pieces and one of them has some super hot wasabi and you don't know which one until you eat it.   If you are the one who get's it you, take a shot of saki (which comes with the roll); however, since my niece is underage, we had a \"shot\" of soy milk.   I got the hot piece and it was HOT!   What a fun experience.  I wish we had a vegan sushi place near me in Florida!More"}
{"review":"This was a fun family experience.  The presentation and taste of the food was fantastic.  We particularly liked the Boddy and Soul, Prime Suspect, and Shizen Shiitake.  I did think the prices were comparable to sushi with more expensive seafood ingredients.  And I particularly did...not like the waiter selling the \"kids\" table (ages 25, 21, and 17) the most expensive sake on the menu.  A good experience, but probably will not return.More"}
{"review":"The vegan sushi here is out of this world!! Unique combinations and incredible flavour!! On par with Shojin in LA. We tried Open Invitation, Boddy and Soul, and Colonel's Pipe. Everything was phenomenal!! I am really eyeing that Spicy Garlic Miso Ramen-- the photos look...amazing!! The simple classic vegan rolls are a good price, the Speciality Rolls are pricier because they are special :) loaded with goodness. They are only doing take out at the moment-- no dine in, no delivery, they aren't affiliated with any delivery services, so it might not be so convenient unless you're right in the neighbourhood. There aren't any parks around for a nice picnic! But if you can find a way, you won't be disappointed with the delicious sushi!More"}
{"review":"Excellent vegan sushi!\n\nProbably the best vegan sushi we had so far since relocating to San Francisco!!\n\nLove it!"}
{"review":"Great food. Service is really good as well once you are seated. This is a vegan sushi & Japanese restaurant with a creative menu. Food comes quickly once you order. However, as reported by others, the wait to get seated is long. We were in...a huge line outside the restaurant on a Saturday night at 450pm, & they opened at 5pm. We had an estimated seating time of 620pm but got seated at 610pm. We loved the Body & Soul, Secret Weapon, Spicy Miso Garlic Ramen, donut desert, & smores desert. The brussel sprouts, corn, and agedashi tofu were okay. This place and Cha-Ya Restaurant are both great, with Cha-Ya having a more traditional menu, but no long waits like Shizen.More"}
{"review":"After having the amazing privilege of being able to periodically eat here for the past few years, I look forward to and savor it each time.\n\nShizen is an impressive restaurant. Even the non-veg folks we've brought here have often said it's the best restaurant...they've ever been to.\n\nYes, Shizen is a beautiful space, sure the service is good, but it's the food that is the star and ALL of it is outstanding, usually in presentation and always in taste.More"}
{"review":"The concept of vegan sushi seems like an oxymoron but this small restaurant makes it happen. It is admirable that the owners created the cuisine to promote sustainability. Beyond that, the dishes themselves are nothing short of remarkable. \n\nIf you are a sushi fan, you\u2019ll...find it hard to believe there is no fish in these little gems. If sushi is not your thing, the vegan variety may well make you a fan.\n\nGive it a try... you won\u2019t be disappointed. Be sure to make a reservation!More"}
{"review":"Lovely atmo, nice attentive service, and hugely in demand for seating this is a fantastic dinner option as well as being fully vegan friendly.  Sushi is the star here, but the cold noodle dishes were also quite nice.  Strong props to the coconut frozen dessert....Immensely important tip:  The only way to not wait for hours for a seat is to use the YELP app to book in advance.  Book EARLY.More"}

{"review":"First time in Sausalito and we had the pleasure of finding this wonderful restaurant to celebrate my birthday. When we arrived, we were told there was a wait time of 30 mins. Very kindly we were offered the drink menu and a table to wait...while ours was ready. We asked for a table on the terrace which has a beautiful view of the bay. To our surprise, we were still deciding on the drinks and were told that a table was ready for us. ( We had tried the restaurant next door Scomas, which I advise you to stir clear of, for they have no idea how to treat a customer. The hostess very rudely said there was no room on the terrace and if we wanted to go on the waiting list to dine it would be another hour and 30 mins.)\nThank God they didn't have room this way we had the opportunity to be treated very professionally like true guests, at The Trident.\nOur waiter Carlos, really must love his profession for he makes a person really feel welcome. Thank you for the wonderful service.\nWe ordered the Ceviche for appetizers and sparkling wine. The Ceviche was very well prepared and delicious. \nFor entrees, we had the Seafood platter with vegetables and mashed potatoes, and the fish tacos. The food was all so fresh and exquisite. Definitely the place to go if you appreciate good food and wonderful service.More"}

I think they need a little jazzing up with some spices but with the squeeze of lime and a little salt I thought they were enjoyable.

{"review":"Let\u2019s start with positive-there is a big drop from the street entrance to the best viewing tables but this problem is very well handled by two ramps which make handicapped persons easily able to access all areas of the place, including out door table seating....Service was puzzling-no bread was offered, and my companion, a visitor from the Midwest,  loves SF sourdough bread. Nor was water offered, and after dinner, though we asked to see the desert menu,  were presented instead with our bill.\nMy companion had salmon, that was ok, but given the $41.00 price, was on the smallish size: the menu for the salmon promised fingerling  potat oes and beans plus other veggies- neither appeared with our salmon. I had the San Francisco stew, Ciopino. The dish I was served fell far short of real Cioppino in a very important way- the tomato based soup- their soup was thin and watery - I could be more tolerant of Cioppino offered at a steak and chop place- but as a place right on the water seeking recognition for its seafood, the meal was a disappointment! As Dungeness crab is not currently not available in San Francisco, I asked the waiter did the crab come from Seattle, and he said he would ask the chef, which he never did. For all these reasons, I would suggest that visitors pick out one of the tables that offer panoramic views of the Bay, then order a variety appetizers and drinks- views are the best products of this eatery!More"}

One of the best chinese foods I have had for a long time.\n\nMogu fish was superb - do try it.\nVeg options - egg plant dishes and green beans were great.  \nA chicken dish we got was...amazing too.\n\nOverall we felt that the dishes had a good mix of spice - yes, its not bland and very tasty.\n\nThe chef Peter Fang does care about his guests.More"}
{"review":"Not much on ambience and place is crowded. \n\nNeed to be fairly quick in knowing what you want. \n\nService is OK but no set waiter (we had four different attendants. \n\nFood was fresh and delicious. A little more Chinese Chinese rather than American Chinese. \n\nCrispy...beef (very tender) and bok choy was excellent.  House noodles a bit bland. \n\nStarters OK. \n\nReasonable prices.More"}
{"review":"I typed in best Chinese in San fransisco and this place came up and others but I liked the sound of the name \ud83d\ude02 we were seated quick and I ordered shezchuan chicken but got sesame chicken instead but glad I did it was beautiful....My husband asked for curry and got satay.  We had people sitting next to us and it turned out it was the pilots that flew us to San Francisco what a coincidence and we also  were near people we met on a tour that day. The pilots told us that Jamie Oliver came to learn Chinese food in the restaurant and that keanu reaves was there filming the matrix there. There are pictures in the wall of both of them. Great restaurant the food is beautiful and massive portions so one curry could do 2 people and reasonable prices too. Definetly recommend anyone visiting the restaurantMore"}
{"review":"When we researched top-shelf authentic Chinese cuisine in San Francisco, HoN was listed in the top five, so we gave it a try. When you arrive the place looks very much like a hole in the wall restaurant, but don\u2019t let that fool you. Step...inside, imagine that you\u2019re in any metropolitan city in China, find a seat, if you can, and order some of the most sublime wonton soup you\u2019ll ever eat (not the ubiquitous watery, soy sauce infused weak pork broth with a tasteless dumpling and maybe a few slices of green onion floating on top you find in \u201cAmerican-style Chinese restaurants!) - HoN\u2019s soup served two and had the most delicious, rich broth with tons of umami, perfect dumplings and crispy rice and seasoning. The side of egg rolls were the best I\u2019ve ever had, and tasted made to order. The hot tea will blow you away with warmth and flavor, just don\u2019t mind the dried flower floating around that gives it just a touch of floral bouquet. Make this one of your go-to spots in Chinatown for great authentic Chinese cuisine.More"}
{"review":"Amazing food!  We got shrimp pockets and tofu steamed buns for appetizer. Split house noodles with tofu.  Had black bean sauce that was perfect! Everything looked great and everyone around us was loving their food. Outside or inside dining.  Busy place but they keep it...moving.  Was a past \u201cChopped\u201d on Food Network winner!More"}
{"review":"Possibly the worst Chinese food we\u2019ve had. Sesame chicken was mostly breading, smothered in a sweet sauce, and not a large portion for $18. Other tables ordered same thing and theirs seemed bigger? Potstickers were deep fried. They were ok but I\u2019ve had much better....Very touristy due to some Food Network connection? Not worthy of the crowd. I don\u2019t recommend.  (While in SFO we also ate at Lai Hong Lounge which had fabulous food and friendly warm service)More"}
{"review":"We ordered sesame chicken and a shrimp appetizer with 1 \u201clarge\u201d sake and the bill was $100 . All the food was fried and overcooked. I didn\u2019t know the items were fried as menu does not indicate that. It was disappointing."}
{"review":"Don\u2019t judge a book by it s cover. The setting is super basic. However, food is excellent!\nIt is a fast moving restaurant - so don\u2019t expect to have a romantic dinner. \nWell worth to go there!"}
{"review":"Very nice interior with food to match. Location is great and within walking distance of many landmarks. Would highly recommend."}
{"review":"We returned to Scala's Bistro to celebrate our 40th wedding anniversary. Our last visit had been several years ago as we live in the UK. The experience began well, frioendly reception and the welcome from the waitress. The starters were OK but I was still...eating mine when our main course was plonked (no other word for it) on the table. The mains, we had chosen their fish of the day a Dorade, was deep fried, greasy and hugely disappointing. We shared a desert, during which time the bill was delivered to our table. No aplomb, no subtlety. There were very few customers at the time, (it was 6.00pm) so no-one was waiting for our table. We were well dressed and polite, so not an embarrassment (!) but we felt as though we were being rushed out. With our 50CL of house wine and a single cocktail, and a shared desert, the bill came to over $200, which we felt was an insult. Of course we should have complained but instead we politely tipped the waitress and left. The next evening we tried Lori's Diner, which is close by. Funky, good honest food, friendly staff and a bill of $60. We really wished we had celebrated there as we were both cross and disappointed that such a special evening had been ruined.More"}
{"review":"Uh-oh \u2013 it sounds like you didn\u2019t see the value in your meal at Scala's. Our chef is a fanatic about buying local, super-fresh ingredients from trusted farmers, which can make dishes on the menu feel a bit on the pricey side. Please reach out...More"}

It was huge and had an amazing dressing. I also had the...duck and it was amazing, as well. The mixed rice and quinoa was great under the duck. My wife\u2019s goat cheese salad was also very tasty and was a meal in itself. The hostess and waiters for all super friendly and informative. The prices were fairly reasonable for Union Square. We will be back.More"}

{"review":"My date and I were scurrying around Union Square trying to find someplace that could accommodate us on short notice.  We had flown to San Francisco from Seattle to see the musical Hamilton and we needed early seating to make a 7:00 opening.  Nathaly, the...Maitre D\u2019, realized I was trying to make this a very special day for a very special lady in my life.  With a throng of people waiting for tables, she said \u201ccome back at 5:00 and we will take care of you\u201d.  \n\nSure enough, arriving at 5 we found they had set up a table by the window in the bar for us.  This made our evening (well, this and seeing Hamilton).  The food was wonderful, the atmosphere exactly what you\u2019d want as you prepare for an evening in the city, it was magic.  \n\nNathaly was one of a handful of people that made our stay for the weekend absolutely wonderful.  I will strive to visit Scala\u2019s every time we return to San Francisco.More"}

Is it the savory sauce on the pork shoulder...pappardelle?  Is it the inventive seafood and apps that could be a meal? The old-school vibe and welcoming staff? The pizza?  The convenient Union Square location? Yeah, it's all that.\n\nWe first tried Scala's after a show when we were staying at its host hotel, the St. Francis, and have looked forward to every visit since.More"}

{"review":"We went here for our last night in San Francisco and were slightly underwhelmed. If I could give it 3.5 stars I would. Why not more than that? Firstly, the number of very positive reviews had raised our expectations. The ambiance is more American diner...than mid-market restaurant and they lost points for delivering the first indifferent wine of our San Francisco and Napa trip, a rather jammy Pinot Noir. It was probably not helped by being pretty empty on a Monday evening. Service was OK, the prawn cocktail description raised hopes of a massive shrimp offering which was actually five reasonably large shrimp around a thin flute of lettuce. Seafood fettuccine was good. So, adequate, but not one than that.More"}

{"review":"We just had to do the Fisherman's Wharf dinner right on the water and Franciscan fit the bill as we scanned the area.  We hit it just right as it was between the lunch and dinner crowds and our table was right at the window...with a perfect view of Alcatraz.  The restaurant is so open and bright with views all around of the bay.  Staff is very friendly and attentive, and our visit gave us the 'nice meal' vibe.  \n\nRound of drinks and a variety of seafood entrees did not disappoint and were all very tasty.

Food-wise, you might cut trough the fancy staff, not pay the premium (but still too much) and just have something on the...go from nearby.

Watching the sea lions play in the ocean and ships cruise...by with Alcatraz as the backdrop was fantastic.  Drinks were very good.\nAverage: Food was good but not great.  No bread offered for my Cioppino until I was done, shells in almost every bite of crab fettuccine.\nBad:  Im sorry to say the service was terrible.  We had to wave someone down to get crab utensils and a second drink.  Not successful at even getting anyone\u2019s attention to bring us our check 20 minutes after finishing our meal.

The restaurant I could tell , caters more to families and groups of 4 or more . Not as many tables for two  but they have a long bar facing the kitchen , and one can watch the chefs prepare dinner . The restaurant fills up fast starting at 4 pm , it wasn\u2019t actually full but lots of customers .\n     The bread here is wonderful , I could have taken a loaf home . Wish I had asked who supplied there bread . Comes with butter and a small dipping bowl filled with olive oil and plenty of garlic ( think Stinking Rose ) loved it . The House Salad with blue cheese crumbles was surprisingly nice size . The Italian dressing was very nice  not overpowering .  One special of the day was Dungeness Crab Ravioli. It was wonderful in a pink sauce that was very good . Lots of good ravioli\u2019s mmmmmm . The Chicken Piccata was very good as well. Nice portions , lots of lemon and a wonderful sauce for dipping that wonderful bread . There was no room for dessert , tempting but passed . Next time . The house wine , is a very nice Pino Grigio went well with dinner . And I should say affordable ..  thank you Rocco\u2019s ! \n      We will be back , perhaps for lunch some day or another early dinner . The atmosphere and ambience is just what you want in a Italian cafe.More"}

I got off my wallet and ordered prons and pasta and it was delicious.  $23 for dinner in SF is cheap. It was worth every penny and I will be coming here again.

{"review":"Easily the most hidden gem in Downtown San Francisco let alone in the city at all! Family owned for ten years!! Love this place!"}

{"review":"Found this restaurant by coincidence as it is located across the street from our hotel (Grant Hotel). My son and I had the rib-eye, which was absolutely  divine and cooked to perfection perfection. The staff was very friendly and gave us useful ideas for hiking...trails in Yosemite.

{"review":"Normally really like ailment when visiting SF. - good food and sangria. Have been twice this week and the staff are lovely. Today dropped by from my hotel for dinner. Sat 18th March. OMG the bartender was obnoxious. He has central character syndrome and thinks...it\u2019s all about him and his \u2018performance\u2019, often loud bitchy comments re clientele eg \u2018you seatyourself, you serve yourself\u2019. He chatted to a friend at the bar for ages, had to flag him repeatedly for service. Urgh, just urgh. Guy with a beard. Regularly lovely bartender, maybe owner, with glasses, then took Over thankfully as this \u2018bro\u2019 (his self reference, gave me a headacheMore"}

Nice atmosphere created with music too. Thank you for a great experience!More"}
{"review":"Headed to this place following a review of opentable as it was just a block away from our hotel and we didnt want to venture far. We all had burgers which were delicious. Place was full of locals, quite loud but nice buzz to it....Food great and service friendly and spot on. Enjoyed it so much headed back a few days later for quick lunch before heading to airport. Sat outside and enjoyed salmon salad, cranapple salad and others had burgers again. Would recommend and visit again when back in SF!More"}
{"review":"I\u2019m not really into Asian Fusion food, but I have to say, lunch here may\u2019ve made me change my mind.  I\u2019ve eaten here for breakfast\/brunch, but today, I had a late lunch and realized it\u2019s Thai Fusion.  Wasn\u2019t jazzed but at the same time, whatever...the table next to me had, I was like WHOA.  I ended up pointing to the table across from me and ordering \u2018whatever that table is having\u2019.  Turns out it was the Hot Stonepot and the Pimped Up Ramyun.  FYI, I am not sure if the entrees are made for a single portion, but we ordered two entrees for four.  There is just no one a super hungry person can finish one plate.  I would order less and add on if necessary.   \n\nThe waitress and staff are very friendly and as speedy as the food came out after ordering, I opted to wait a little to order bc my group was late.\n\nOverall, great tasting food, good service, good quality for the money.  I would def go back. \n\nOh, I didn\u2019t take advantage of this, but they have bottomless mimosas for $26.  It\u2019s limited to one hour but if you can get three glasses in (big pours and not over juiced), it\u2019s worth it.    \n\nParking can be challenging but I know the area, so I parked at 1598 Bay Street around the condos (no parking meters) and just walked over (10 min).More"}
{"review":"This Thai fusion restaurant  puts out beautifully presented  dishes.  However the SPRING ROLLS  are pretty  but taste like PAPER so don\u2019t bother with this appetizer especially considering the price.They are doing the best they can with covid I guess\u2026 there is no one on the...host desk so it took a long time to be acknowledged\u2026  we were desperate because we had time limitations. \nSo bottom line\u2026. Pretty good food . Large portions. I recommend getting two dishes for 4 people. We were four people. 4  beer that were the restaurant pic.. and the spring roll appetizer \u2026250 dollars with tip!!! WHAT??????  ABSOLUTELY RIDICULOUs pricing for Thai food.     \nIf you go\u2026 just  be aware . If you are ok with outrageously priced food\u2026 then  go for it.More"}
{"review":"Maybe they are a new restaurant. Maybe they are just opening up after a long break due to COVID. Maybe they have enough business that they don't need to care what customers think. We walked past the mostly-empty restaurant and decided to stop in. Immediately...accosted by a server to ask if we had a reservation, which we didn't, we were led to a small 2-top and then essentially ignored for 10 minutes, despite there being few other guests in the restaurant. Obnoxious high-decibel 6-some across the aisle put on quite a show, laughing and dropping utensils, generally making a racket, without intervention by restaurant staff. Eventually placed our order, and my Pad Thai ($17.50!) arrived within 5 minutes and my wife's 2 fried eggs and fried potatoes ($15.50!) arrived about 15 minutes later. Not sure why it would take an empty restaurant 15 minutes to fry 2 eggs, or why they couldn't serve 2 mains at the same time -- there were no excuses because there were few other guests. Couldn't get out of there fast enough. Not recommended.More"}

Very busy place, even when dining it seems like a very fast paced environment....The food was great - definitely have the millionaires bacon - I had it in the Blackstone Benny, delicious.More"}
{"review":"Had dinner for the first time at Blackwood on Chestnut St  in the Marina District.  This has long been a favorite breakfast stop when we visit SF, but was equally delighted with their dinner menu.  As always service was good, and wine selection went well...with meals on the menu.\n\nMy shrimp on fried rice was jumbo shrimp - similar to lobster tails in size - served in shells on a bed of flavorful and moist fried rice that was captured under a net of egg that was thin and looked to be done on a waffle iron.  I am not a big egg person, but this was great, and did not taste like a traditional egg.  Dessert was a good way to top off the meal and to share.\n\nWill definitely add this to our dinner rotation the next time we stay in the Cow Hollow neighborhood - which is our favorite place to stay in SF. The name Cow Hollow is derived from the fact that when SF was a young city this area was a dairy. No sign of cows remain, but this neighborhood has great restaurants, shops, and several nice smaller hotels that offer free parking on site.More"}
{"review":"We were a group of five old friends gathering for a holiday dinner.  The pan-Asian menu includes a variety of Thai, Vietnamese and Chinese options.  All were delightful.  Our waitress was helpful in avoiding dishes with ingredients some of us were allergic to.  The drinks...were strong and tasty.  The vibe was young and friendly, and the noise level was JUST on the bearable side.  They have the largest indoor video screen I've ever seen, bit with no audio.More"}

Bill came up to $80 for breakfast and nothing about the visit was that special.

We shared the fettuccine Siena pasta and the mountain pizza. All the food was SO delicious!! I could not recommend...this restaurant any more. It was really fairly priced for the quality we were served. Very friendly service too.More"}
{"review":"We came here yesterday following the good comments left on TripAdvisor and were very disappointed by both the owner's welcome and the quality of the pizzas on offer. We had originally planned to dine there and were asked to wait 15 minutes as there was...no room in the dining room. I left for 5 minutes, leaving my wife to wait. When I returned, the owner had refused her a table that had become available on the pretext that I wasn't there and in a very unpleasant tone of voice. We were asked to wait again until a table became available. After waiting 15 minutes we decided to order a pizza to take away. This was served 15 minutes later. In short, 45 minutes after our arrival we paid 25 dollars for a medium-sized pizza that could be compared to the 12 euros pizzas sold in chain pizza restaurants in France. Worthless. Reputation more than usurped.More"}

{"review":"Fantastic Italian food for (low) prices not normal for San Francisco. We had to wait more than an hour for an available table, but was worthwhile."}
{"review":"Classic neighborhood pizzeria, with huge portions of pasta too. Very tiny place with small number of tables, so they don't accept groups of more than six. Fast, friendly service, delicious food and the house red was good too."}
{"review":"Just across the street from our hotel. Got a table at 5pm for an early supper. It ticked the box. Nothing fancy, friendly service and a reasonable cost for SF."}

The size was plenty for me, as I'm a big...eater and finished it. I'm glad I ordered early, as was starting to get busy inside at 5.30pm.More"}
{"review":"Amazing little Italian place.  Food amazing.  I had the lasagna. The service was fast and good.  Maybe  little too cocky.

But food was delicious.More"}

{"review":"Uncle Vito is a traditional Italian diner with a no-nonsense flair and ambiance.  The entrance leads customer into the small walkway next to a large and behind-the-counter kitchen where pizzas and  pastas are prepped freshly by the down-to-earth cooks.  An open door leads to a...nice dining area of 7 tables of 2 - 4 seats each, where singles, couples and small groups dine.  The staff can be moody: sometimes super-friendly and sometimes curt.  Prices are reasonable. \n\nTheir very tasty Lasagne comes with a large tomato salad  & a side garlic bread.  Their pizzas arrived to tables hot and fresh.  Check out the Mountain Pizza if you're a meat eater who wants some finely roasted veggies - even the  small size will satisfy 2 people or you could ask for a box to pack your leftover pizza.  Their tomato sauce is rich and deep.  Did we see Uncle Vito in a Hawaiian shirt? This place is a bustling take-out or takeaway business and have seats for 4 seat for people waiting for their take-outs.  Various people stopped in to pick up mostly pizzas  and sometimes pastas, but the dining area is well-spaced and quieter.  Buon Appetito!More"}

{"review":"I have lived in san francisco for 20 years and never had a worse experience.  Our reservation, made 48 hours in advance, was cancelled after we were 5 minutes late.  The restaurant was unapologetic and indifferent despite being well with their stated window of 10...minutes to cancel the reservation.  \n\nI waited to write this review to ensure a fair perspective (aka not hangry) but upon reflection several hours later I am still astounded at how the restaurant completely served themselves over their customer.  \n\nI am done with Isa.More"}
{"review":"Wow! What an amazing find. We were visiting San Francisco on our anniversary and wanted a special place to eat. I searched Open Table, but you never really know. But something really connected with me when I saw Isa. When we arrived I still was...not sure but that all changed after the first minute. The owner greeted us and told us about the over 20 year history of his restaurant and how all key staff, the chef and more have also been there over 20 years. Moments after we were seated, Dean came to tell us about the menu and what were the best things on the menu. We ordered them. The Dungeness Crab salad and Potato Wrapped Seabass. There really are no words to describe how amazing those dishes were. Just amazing. And the service matched. All I can say is you live or visit San Francisco, this is a must visit.More"}
{"review":"With so many places to eat in San Francisco, I have to say this was one of my favorites.  \n\nThe food was really good, ambiance was on fleek, granted we were the last party to arrive at 9:45pm, and service was impeccable (thank you Priscilla)....We had anyone and everyone waiting on us.  Never had a dirty plate on the table or an empty glass.  The manager even came by to say hello and check in on us.  \n\nThis is what we ordered, and ALL was delicious and generous in size.  Shockingly the bill was just $160 pre tip.  Corkage is included in that total and was only $26 per bottle.   \n\nButter Lettuce Salad\nYellowtail Hamachi\nHangar Steak\nTruffle Risotto\nSide of Brussel Sprouts \nPort Wine \nTrio of ice cream \n\nI would DEFINITELY come back again!  \n\nWe walked from our condo so didn\u2019t experience parking issues, but looking at the surroundings, parking can be tight.

We will definitely be back and highly recommended.More"}
{"review":"The back patio is nice.  Probably the most fun service I have ever gotten at a restaurant however it was hard to miss the slow delivery of food and drinks.  I was impressed with the relatively low mark up on some pretty good wines.  I...can't award 5 stars due to the small portions.More"}
{"review":"We had an absolutely awful experience at Isa after holding our rehearsal dinner there - the owner, Sam, robbed us of $1000. BEWARE! We saw reviews warning about scams here and should have paid more attention.\n\nWe put down a $1000 deposit months before our...event that was to be credited on our bill. At the end of the event, the $1000 was never credited back. We assumed this was an oversight, and reached out to Sam to correct it, but he proceeded to gaslight us an insist that we \"should be grateful\" for all the work he put in and admonished us for \"caring about more money\" than all his efforts. It has turned into such a nightmare and looks like we will need to go to smalls claims if we ever want to see our money again.More"}
{"review":"The food was really good but the portions were so small and so expensive. We left hungry. Had to go back to our hotel and order more food and drinks. Plus we felt like they were trying to get our party out of there way...too fast. Drink eat leave.More"}
{"review":"Beware of scam for events \u2014 the manager Sam stole our $1000 security deposit.\n\nEven with the promise of a \"security deposit which will be fully credited\", he refused to return it because he \"made less money than anticipated.\" He was extremely inconsiderate and rude,...and we will have to settle this in small claims court.\n\nWe read the previous reviews about his scams and went ahead with the event anyways, but were disappointed\u00a0to learn that it would happen to us as well. Just know that if you give him any money, it is gone for good.\n\nIt is a shame because this was a beautiful event space, with good food and a nice wait staff. We were left with an extremely bitter taste in our mouth though, and would recommend skipping Isa altogether to avoid this experience.More"}
{"review":"Did you ever walk into a restaurant and were almost sure you\u2019d like it? That\u2019s Isa\u2019s.

My glasses steaming up felt good....We had just come from the Palace of Fine Arts to see the Art of Banksy\u2014our Uber driver couldn\u2019t find us in the dark parking lot and vice versa. So, upon arrival, we asked for the warmest table in the room and were shown one near the heater in the crowded, but noisy back room. Changing our minds, we asked for a table in the front room and settled down to discuss the show and the food. We shared the salad of butter lettuce, poached apple, candied walnuts and Pt. Reyes blue cheese. My main course was the cleverly potato-wrapped seabass with capers, peppers and tomato confit. My friend choose the seared scallops with mashed potatoes, butternut squash with bacon--we shared a side dish of Brussel sprouts with bacon and garlic (yum-yum).  Couldn\u2019t fit in dessert\u2014maybe next time. The host and wait staff were gracious on this very busy Sunday evening.More"}

Everything else was spot on.  Please when in San Francisco, please support the businesses.More"}
{"review":"We arrived at 5:30 pm for dinner with no reservations. There was only one couple at the tables and 4 people at the bar. We were greeted by the bartender and then seated after a couple minutes of waiting. We ordered from the pre-fix menu...and then the SLOW down began. It took about 20 minutes for two bowls of creamed cauliflower soup to arrive. Although it was good we were disappointed that they didn't have the cauliflower and fennel soup as listed on the menu. And yes we were advised of the change when the waiter took our order. Ok, done with the soup and another 25+ minute wait for the fish dish to arrive and then 3 more minutes after that for the roasted chicken dish to arrive. Once those dishes were cleared it took about 5 minutes to get our creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e. All the food was very good but the slow service was an issue. We still had to walk back to catch a concert. Over 90 minutes just felt too long as we were not having a 9 course meal. We also over heard the group next to us complain about waiting for their food. In summary, the food was very good but don't have plans after your dinner, you're going to be in Isa for awhile!More"}
{"review":"Sat at the bar and had their prix Fixe dinner with a friend.  There were lots of choices on the menu, and they were served promptly. Food quality was good, and they made an effort to make sure we were happy.  All in all an...excellent meal at a reasonable price.More"}

{"review":"On our first night in San Francisco where we hadn\u2019t  been in a few years, I knew we wanted to eat in the Castro.  What a great find Poesia is.  We liked their back garden, and the service couldn\u2019t have been better.  We shared the...burrata, among the beat I\u2019ve had, and the nectarine salad (clever combination). We had for entrees the bolognese (very good) and the frutti de mare which was delicious.  Excellent meal.  Highly tecommendedMore"}
{"review":"In San Francisco for a Landmark Birthday (the fact of which was included in the comments section of the reservation), we had heard that Poesia has a lovely, warm,homey atmosphere and really good food.  The website itself says the chef is cooking from his own...mother's Italian recipes.\n\nThis is the only time - ever - a restaurant ignored (or simply didn't read) a birthday advisory and do something sweet or considerate (or at least provide a good table).\n\nThe atmosphere was almost painfully noisy, not warm and homey.  And the service was, at best, haphazard (bordering on rude - heaven forbid in the Castro older gay men should be treated at least politely).\n\nAnd the food was just so-so. Not bad, but after having eaten such food in Italy, at my Italian in-laws homes and in good restaurants in NYC, somewhat disappointing.  Of particular note: if you are going to serve a pasta \"frutti di mare\" 95% of it should not be squid, and there should be more than one bite of fish swimming in the sauce. Covering tough pasta.  Deserts were also lackluster, and not accompanied (as in many years prior in other restaurants) with a candle in the canoli or some similar nod to the occasion.\n\nWine list was limited and also not particularly interesting (and only available by the glass).  If I might suggest a Verdicchio from The Marche to round out the limited white wine choices the list would be a bit more interesting.\n\nNot awful.  Not wonderful.  And not for a special occasion.More"}

We had the Caprese con Burrata, Insalata di Spinici e Barbabietole, Bistecca ai Ferri and the Swordfish nightly special. ALL were AMAZING! The service was top of the line as we felt spoiled from...start to finish. Couldn\u2019t ask for a better start to our vacation.More"}
{"review":"This restaurant is my go to dinner place almost every night when I\u2019m back home. The service is impeccable, cozy decor, makes me feel just like home! \n\nThe food is authentic and amazing with daily specials, I never get tired of it! I had multiple...events at the restaurant and both the owner Francesco and the Chef, also has the same name Francesco, always make the events memorable with great wine selections to pair with the great food creation! They are very friendly and engaging with the customers and constantly seek to do better in all aspects! \n\nA must try if you are in San Francisco!More"}
{"review":"That sums it up really. Authentic, Italian family style restaurant with great food and friendly very attentive service. Slightly hidden upstairs. Was just right for our last night in San Fran after a long day of \"touristing\"."}
{"review":"So I have been to many \u201cAuthentic\u201d Italian bistros, but there is definitely something about this place. Ambiance and staff are exceptional and the menu is not overly complicated. Simple limited items but very well executed.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to go to dinner, and worry about...what your going to get. The flavors and presentation are out of this world and I am a very picky person when it comes to pasta and sauces.\n\nThe lamb Ragu was perfectly braised lamb shank with just the right amount of tomato sauce. Flavors and spices are truly authentic.\n\nThe place is quite small and is definitely a hot spot so make sure you do reservations. \n\nDesserts were traditional and nicely portioned.More"}
{"review":"Nice atmosphere in the Castro, waiter was lovely and food was ok, some dishes better than others. I recommend the mussels and the calamari."}
{"review":"Our server was very well versed on the items on the menu.....and his recommendation on the daily specials were spot on.  We ordered a starter, a salad, a pasta dish ,the sole, and tiramisu.......dishes that which we shared.  The portions were generous and the ambience...was very nice.More"}
{"review":"A great place to go with a colleague, a friend, or on a date. The staff are super friendly, the food is delicious, they have a full bar, and they have an amazing wine list!"}
{"review":"I was a little reluctant due to this being a large chain. However, I've got to say the food was really good. The server was Roberto and he was brilliant. What was on offer surprised me, but they did really well."}

{"review":"Food was great and I have never had such a nice server! Azzo is extremely kind hearted and very efficient. All the best to him for making this place even more wonderful. Feel at home with him!"}
{"review":"We ate here 15 years ago on a trip to San Francisco so we decided to give it another go on our recent trip. IT seems like they have cheaped out a little on the food now. The portions were smaller and not as good....The waitstaff are all running all over the place out of their minds and barely have time to give the patrons much attention. I am not sure that we would go back. People did seem to keep pouring in the door  though. Maybe we will see what it is like in the next 15 years!More"}
{"review":"We eat here a couple of times while staying in San Francisco. Was great, we loved it. Food and service both superb. The second time our waiter Oliver was particularly awesome. We qualified for some free glasses but we were concerned about our weight allowance...on flight home so he kindly exchanged them for some more suitable glasses that were not so heavy. Great place.More"}

Their seasonal cocktails that our server recommended...were delicious. An overall great experience, thank you Juli for the phenomenal service!More"}

We unfortunately had a small little hiccup with our meal,\nbut with the help of our server Melissa and the manager James, they made this the best experience...we've ever had. They both treated us like family and well 100% be coming back because of their jokes, ambience and friendliness.More"}
{"review":"We were in San Francisco for a couple of days and at the insistence of my father, being a fan of \"Forrest Gum\", it was a must stop. In my opinion the food was delicious compared to other Bubba's however the view was one of...the best things the sunset was wonderful. Despite waiting for a few minutes on the waiting list, the service is excellent, Claudia was exceptional (I loved her look) she gave us a couple of minutes to chat and play with my father about questions and answers about the movie and she gave us a courtesy for the next time we return, it was JUST FUN! She\u2019s so funny. We will definitely come back to this next year hoping nothing has changed.More"}
{"review":"My husband and I came to San Francisco for vacation it was on my bucket list of places to visit. Bubba Gumps was the first place we had for dinner.

{"review":"Mong Kok Riga, Latvia I am agreat fan of Chinese foods and have ahd it in CHINA PROC, British Hong Kong, Singapore, Brussels, Berlin, Sweden Lithuania and Latvia. I was delighted when I found this place, a stone's throw from my offices and at fair...price. That has changed now it is no less than 5.5 eur which is too much to have and to pay when you want less. Also, the persons selling have no clue, one Chinese thinks he can speak English gets all orders wrong, it was much better when the senior lady was in place, now just youngsters - clueless. No communication with the customer how soon it will come and frankly the food was cold and tasteless. I will stop buying! Fix these things and I might return.Also very often it is closed without warning,and food runs out fr lunch time and on...but then why be open?More"}
{"review":"The bbq pork steamed buns were disappointing, yes it was a big bun but unfortunately too doughy \ud83d\ude15 the only dim sum was great was the prawn dumplings. Not really worth the wait."}
{"review":"I found this place online based on high reviews.  We tried to go the first day but the line was too long so we moved on.  We came back our last day in town and decided to wait in the line, which was even longer...than the first day.  We found other people waiting in line just because they saw the line and figured it must be good.  After an HOUR wait we finally got our chance to order.  The pricing was cheap but seemed like they kind of just pulled a number from the air based on the amount you ordered.  And the food was good, I mean sure.  But it wasn't worth the hour wait.  We definitely had better on our trip.  It was unique and fun to try so many different things.  We ordered way too much and ended up giving the huge bag of left overs to some homeless who were nearby us.  I would recommend going here if the line is reasonable.  Otherwise I would move on.  I will say the teenage girls loved saying they ate shark fin, even though I'm sure that was just the shape of the pastry and not actually made with shark meat.  And their other favorite was the sugared doughnut.  I loved the scallion bread.  Delicious and soft.  Definitely go here if the line is short, it doesn't move super fast.More"}
{"review":"The food was delish and soooo inexpensive.  No seating. Be ready for a line and READ MENU BEFORE you go to cut down on confusion on what to order. Shrimp dumplings best I've ever had. Chinese donut yummy."}
{"review":"I am sure I am not the first to write a  positive review but I can write from a varied frame of reference. I have had Chinese dim sum in NYC, Flushing, and Vancouver but none is better than here. Traditional dim sum done  in...the traditional way. No contemporary spin just great buns and dim sum.More"}
{"review":"The pork bbq buns were not even exceptionally delicious. I got so disappointed coz the dimsum in nearby restaurants are more delicious. The store also looks dirty."}
{"review":"We were there around 2:00 pm so they were out of several items , but the buns are SOO good- Pineapple & BBQ. There was a line, but it lives quickly. Totally worth the wait"}
{"review":"Worth standing in the long line for. Fresh and tasty.  No parking. Driving through Chinatown is a nightmare!"}
{"review":"There is a line outside because it's simply a small bakery you order for take out. There are plenty of workers, So don't let a long line scare you. Forgot to take pics because we ate it so fast. We had the shrimp dumplings, seafood...shumai, sesame seed balls, bbq pork bun & pork shumai. All for $12.90. They were so shocked when I tipped em cash. \nWhich I should suggest adding to credit card transactions. \nAnother suggestion, cleanlinessMore"}
{"review":"Sticky rice. Just get it. That is all!\nWorth the stand in the line. The dumplings are amazing too.\nPrepare to be treated as if you are a nuisance. Every customer seems to be!!"}
{"review":"I was excited to try this place after reading lots of glowing reviews only to find average food. Actually, the shrimp dumplings were great. But some of the Dim Sum was quite subpar, like the ShuMai. They even looked ugly. But the reviews and lady...in front of me sweared otherwise. Yuck! The Bay Buns were NOT ample and were too sweet with not enough pork. We were a little ill after eating this repast. Not worth it. Subsequently, visited other places that were much better.More"}
{"review":"Came here after reading the reviews. As expected, it was the only bakery on the street with a queue of locals outside waiting for morning dim sum. It's quite good that there is a queue so you can prepare what you are going to order...as you do feel a bit of pressure to be quick considering a lot of people are waiting, and I imagine if you've never had dim sum before it can be a daunting experience knowing what to ask for. Staff don't seem the most friendly but I think they are trying to serve as quickly as possible, and they aren't rude, just don't say much. The food itself was delicious and good size. Definitely great value and would recommend.More"}
{"review":"I wish I could break this review into several smaller reviews. Overall this was an amazing experience. Right in the heart of Chinatown, inside a TINY bakery with dozens of people behind me, it was exactly what I wanted. A little stressful because I didn\u2019t...(still don\u2019t) know what to order and I didn\u2019t want to hold up the line. There are dozens of options. I was fortunate to have a local couple in front of me who gave me several good recommendations. The prices were so low I felt comfortable ordering tons of food just to get a good sampling. I didn\u2019t love everything I ordered, but I liked most of it, and that was the point!More"}
{"review":"Wait in the line. You won\u2019t be disappointed! The dim sum was great and all very fresh. Everything tasted great and we would definitely go back!"}
{"review":"Casual restaurant with a variety of fish platters and bowls.\n\nI recommend the bowls. There are several protein options, including ahi, grilled salmon, and chicken. All bowls have a nice balance of protein, rice, and a variety of vegetables. The medium size bowl is significantly...larger than the small bowl and only costs a few dollars more. Medium size bowl was fairly filling. \n\nThey have happy hour specials on a few draft beers and wine.\n\nService was quick and attentive.\n\nSo it's not a custom SF experience but is a cheerful place to get reasonably priced, quality, healthy seafood.More"}
{"review":"Excellent food. Really fresh. The rainbow bowl was delicious. Good service. Reasonable price for San Fran. Highly recommend"}
{"review":"I had the Hawaiian teriyaki with grilled chicken, and it was the best meal I had on my short visit to San Francisco. The flavor was great, the chicken was moist, and the serving could easily feed two people. Great service, too."}
{"review":"If there was a rating option for service, this would be a -1 *.\n3* is for the food.\nWith the remodel, natch, prices have risen quite a bit. $32 for Salmon! But my friend really enjoyed his meal, actually all of us did.\nBut...every time I go here for a meal, the service is non existent.\nI find myself giving myself better service, by having to constantly seek out my server, for service that should be a no brainer. Much easier to eat if one has silverware.\nThis was no different this past Sat. 11\/12\/2022, when 3 of us dined for lunch at 12:30 PM. We were all looking forward to this lunch after a long stroll through the Botanical Gardens.\nWe all got a bad vibe right from the get go.\nOne of our guests uses an electric wheelchair.\nSo they seat us in the middle of the dining room, right in the line of traffic coming from the kitchen. Well, they showed us to our table and didn't remove any chair so our friend could roll up to the table. Geez, common sense test #1, all other tests they failed.\nI shall not go forth with this review, as it's not favorable, other than the food.\nI will say the fried Calamari was FANTASTIC.\nDon't bother with the \"Crab Mashed Potatoes\", there was no crab in site and it was $3 more if chosen as one of your sides.More"}
{"review":"When I booked a reservation here, I thought it was a nice seafood restaurant that would have great dining ambiance after a walk around Golden Gate Park. What we got was a fast food chain with a greasy interior. Our waiter was slow as could...be. So slow in fact, that two other waitresses came over to ask if we were being helped and the second one had to track our waiter down. The food was average, on par with Applebee's. Nothing exciting. We saw they are closing next week for a remodel - it needs it! We'll skip this place in the future.More"}
{"review":"Had food delivered by Uber Eats one night.  Because the driver didn't even ring the bell as we asked, and literally left our food on the sidewalk (after we pre-tipped him.  Won't make that mistake again), it was cold and nasty.  \n\nBut we decided to...visit the restaurant in person a few nights later.  I've seldom been greeted by a more bored or disinterested host.   This was the ONLY place that asked for our vaccine cards in SF and when we couldn't produce them we had to be seated on the cold patio.  The host was really sort of rude about it.  When we found our vaccine certificates and came inside to be seated you'd have expected \"oh you found them.  Great.\" Instead he seemed DISAPPOINTED like we'd beaten him somehow.  \n\nOur waiter was MUCH better, nice, personable, but the atmosphere of the whole place was off.  Felt sort of like a lower end place.  The food was okay.  Nothing special.  We won't go backMore"}

Was delicious and a perfect light dinner!More"}
{"review":"With half the inside tables empty on a coldish evening, the restaurant insisted they only had outdoor tables  (no heat lamps). The taco shells were wet and soggy and fell apart before you could finish picking them up. The items were cold, stale and tasted...awful. The fish tasted like rubber. This would be a good place to go if there was no other food in the world. Otherwise, skip it. On the positive side, the wait staff was very nice. Horrible horrible horrible.More"}
{"review":"Had a great lunch after attending Bouquet to Arts at the DeYoung. We were greeted and seated quickly. Since it was a nice day we opted for the outdoor Tiki themed former parking lot seating. Very pleasant and surprisingly warm (for SF). We both ordered...the Large Hawaii poke bowl and the fish was perfect - high quality tuna, seasoned just enough, over a generous bed of sushi rice.  The side wakame salad, pickled cucumbers over a salad mix was also very nice.  Great lunch for $18. There was a smaller size for $16 which probably would have been plenty but was hungry and aside from the rice it was a low cal lunch.  Highly recommended for quality of food and service.More"}
{"review":"I have eaten at this restaurant many times and have never been disappointed.  The menu has a wide selection of healthy options at reasonable prices.  They have indoor and outdoor seating.  Highly recommend the fish tacos!  They are located across the street from Golden Gate...Park and only 4 block walk to the museum.More"}
{"review":"Was just ta few days ago for a great late lunch before going to the museum.  They have slightly enclosed outdoor dining with heat, and indoor with social distancing. \n\nGreat menu!    Guaca-Poke starter was great!  As was the Poke & Ceviche Trio.  \n\nThe Cobo Calamari...had a great chipotle tasting aioli, just wish the calamari was bigger, but still very tasty.  Great cocktail and other beverage menu.More"}

{"review":"Three of us had dinner here Christmas Eve.  We shared three appetizers and a bottle of wine.  Each ordered his own entree.  Everything was ok, prices not too high, but overall it was not good enough for us to return."}
{"review":"The Pacific Catch is strategically located near the Golden Gate park with a very good view of it. The ambiance is nice and the personal is very courteous. Good food and good beer."}
{"review":"We arrived at happy hour but the hostess did not ask whether we would like a table in the bar or dining area (where happy hour prices do not apply). \n\nWe ordered the ahi-avocado appetizer to share, an ahi burger dinner for each of us,...and a lemongrass mojito.  The appetizer was tasty as was the mojito.  The ahi burger dinner was very disappointing. The ahi patties were thin and cooked all the way through, making them very dry.   The side slaw was fairly wilted rather than fresh.  The only redeeming part was the furikaki seasoned french fries.\n\nTo their credit, when I informed our waitress that the burgers were not good she advised the manager.  After we chatted with him, he credited us for both burgers even though we had not asked him to.  \n\nSo when you visit, find something besides the ahi burgers on their expansive menu. :)More"}

{"review":"My wife and I arrived around 2:15pm.  After a suggestion from our tour guide.  Upstairs we were greeted right away, and asked to go downstairs to the dining room.  There we were greeted right away and seated.  Our server, along with every other employee that...we made contact with during our visit, treated us very well.  Quite friendly, and made us feel right at home.  I ordered the R & G special beef.(special recipe). It looked good, and it tasted good.  Not a wow moment, but still tasty.  Not really enough flavor for me.  I would not order that again.  My wife ordered the diced honey garlic chicken.. That was quite tasty.  Much more flavor.  We had a wonderful visit, and were treated great.  I would certainly love to visit again.More"}
{"review":"Based on the raving reviews we decided to have dinner at R&G Lounge. Despite our reservation we had to wait for over 20 minutes to be seated. Our table was located in the corner of the smelly cellar. Service was super fast, food was unfortunately...mediocre. We liked the fresh vegetables and the fish noodles, the honey chicken was so-so (a bit dry, like they kept the dish warm for too long) and the duck was a disappointment. Though tender, it was too greasy. We love Chinese food and know what it should be like, this was just mediocre.More"}
{"review":"The calamari and the fried rice were amazing. The bartender. Louie, was seriously one of the most outstanding I have ever seen. He engaged every customer and he obviously loves his job.

{"review":"We went there as family for dinner. We had reservations but still waited about 30 minutes. It\u2019s a very busy, popular place.  We had the fried crab, green beans, crispy chicken, stir fry rice, and a pork dish. The fried food was very greasy but...had good flavor. The restaurant is extremely noisy especially when they clear a table. This makes it difficult to have a conversation. I didn\u2019t feel the good was worth all the noiseMore"}

So maybe skip it - pricey as wellMore"}

My husband and I turned up on Lunar New Year\u2019s Day without a booking, but didn\u2019t have to wait long as we were prepared to sit at...one of the high tables on stools.  We ordered a wild mushroom chow mein and the beef brisket and turnip clay pot!  They were both super delicious \u2013 there was a generous portion of mixed Asian mushrooms in the chow mein and the beef brisket was really flavoursome and juicy.  As mentioned in the reviews, it is a little on the pricey side \u2013 but the food is really good!!More"}

{"review":"I've been going here for 23 years and today put me off this place for good. The food has never been anything special but friendly service and atmosphere has always been the draw until today. I was taking my 76 year old mother for her...birthday there and I dropped her off on the street while I was parking.  Then walking to the restaurant she calls me and tell me to hurry up because they would not seat her and my 6 year old son without me being there.  So i ran to Sam's so she wouldn't miss out on our table or stand there for very long. I also told her to tell them I am running from the parking lot and to please seat them.  When I arrived I see them standing by themselves off to the side and not seated.  Then the hostess cheerfully ignorant of her rudeness shows us where the table is.  And then I gave her a piece of my mind about having to run through the parking lot so my 76 year old mother doesn't have to stand there and wait for me so she can sit down at our table. The \"all parties must be present\" policy should not be applied if only one person is missing from a party of 3.  I understand if more than half of a party of 3 or more are not present to use this rule.  But the hostess clearly did not use an ounce of courtesy or common sense when evaluating this situation.  Rude. Done. No more.  We left and had a wonderful birthday meal at Salt and Pepper across the street. The service was friendly and wonderful. The food was great. The waitress even put in my son's order first and was super sweet to him and all of us.  Go there instead!More"}

My son said his burger was the best ever and we shared a Caesar salad that was tasty; most of our party\u2019s meals were enjoyed. \n\nThe service was great. \n\nThe reason for 4 stars rather than...5 was due to the $35.00 Maine lobster roll. We expected chunks of lobster rather than minced with tons of celery, mayo, onion. And there just wasn\u2019t a lot on the bun for that price, frankly.More"}
{"review":"My only experience there is at lunch time. The trick is to get there between the brunch crowd and the lunch crowd. 11:30 seems to work. If you blow it, the wait can be over an hour on the weekend. First off, the views are...wonderful watching the boats go in and out of the harbor. People watching is pretty great, too. Sun umbrellas are pretty plentiful, but lather up anyway because of reflection off the water. The menu is good but not cheap. The wait staff is good and attentive. Everything we have ordered there is really good. Oh, there  is a big parking lot 1\/2 block away.More"}

From the boat dock entrance to the convivial ambience that feels celebratory, to the locals and regulars that lovingly support this restaurant, it is classic Marin.

Classic cocktails and classic uncomplicated fare that doesn't disappoint.More"}

{"review":"I had been to Sam\u2019s many times over the years and always loved going there. A couple of days ago we went and we were looking forward to having a crab Louie.  There were a few little bits of crab sprinkled on the lettuce and...it was totally mushy. I\u2019ve never tasted crab like that, and I\u2019ve had a lot of crab having grown up in the bay area.  It might have been canned or frozen and refrozen many times.  It was disgusting,  totally inedible and I can\u2019t imagine a restaurant serving something like that. My friend and I both sent ours back and they were gracious about it.More"}
{"review":"This restaurant is located on Main Street and has patio seating on the water.  We were there for lunch, and, fortunately, got in line early, because when they opened at 12:00 noon, the line was down the block.  The food was good, not spectacular, and...the service was also good.  We were disappointed that our water glasses and iced tea glasses were not refilled even one time while we were dining.  Once we were served, that was it until we received our check.  The lobster roll sandwich was skimpy, but the salads were very nice.More"}
{"review":"Not good.  Oysters on the half shell were absolutely destroyed by the shucker.  Pieces of shell in the oysters, and hardly recognizable as oysters.  Shrimp cocktail was mushy and chewy at the same time, somehow\u2026 and the crab and shrimp linguine was flavorless.  View was...nice.  Parking lot warnings about theft were certainly off putting.  Definitely a run-down area.More"}
{"review":"The price is solely for the beauty of the setting.\nOur server was not well trained and the policy of asking if you want sparkling or flat water without saying that you are charged for either (tap water is not offered) is unfriendly.  And we...waited for a long time for both the server and the water.\nThe food was okay.  The salad was overdressed.  The bleu cheese was not on the side as requested.  The hot course was brought to our table before our salad and had to be sent back.  And do we not have any local fish in the Bay Area?\nThere is so much better food in Berkeley!More"}
{"review":"Reserved a table for a birthday and, after arriving 5 min late, no table available and 4 parties ahead of us. They blamed it on the customers taking too long to eat. Really??  After 10 minutes, they tried to shunt us off to the bar...area, which we did not want, so we waited another 20 minutes and finally got seated in the restaurant. The food was very good, wait staff also, though it was quite noisy. The view, of course, can't be beat.More"}
{"review":"Go for the view because lately it is the best thing about the restaurant. I'm unable to find information if it has changed ownership but it is definitely been on a downhill decline. Will you still love it but during restaurant week had such a...bad experience that we wound up leaving with Apologies from the manager. We wrote it off as a bad night with the staff and restaurant being overwhelmed and just this week returned for my birthday dinner with family and we're very underwhelmed with not just the food but the service, it's disappointing to say, but I don't think it will be a special occasion destination for my family anymoreMore"}
{"review":"I had been to Skates on the Bay several times years ago and was not overly impressed with their seafood at that time. \n\nI was pleasantly surprised that the food had improved considerably. The farmers market salad was not quite as described- the cauliflower seemed...raw and not charred and I don\u2019t think everything listed was in the salad.. The fish Main dish was excellent. \n\nThe service was very good as was the beautiful view.More"}
{"review":"Been visiting this restaurant for almost 40 years. Today went for brunch lunch. Extremely dissatisfied with the traditional eggs benedict. Very poor for such a traditional item. We had a chicken BLT which was good but the other half of our meal was terrible we're...not order that again. The views were spectacular as usualMore"}
{"review":"The view is worth the price. The food and service are excellent. We brought our toddler with us for an early dinner and we\u2019re catered to very well. The food was incredibly good. The wine list was great also."}
{"review":"Unwashed lettuce in the salad. Very gritty. Inedible. \nThe waiter left for a lunch break in the middle of service and no one replaced him. I had to ask the bartender to help, which she did very graciously. The tuna main dish and the salmon...dish were both excellent. And the view is terrific. However, with so many amazing restaurants in Berkeley I would not go back.More"}
{"review":"There are not many restaurants on the Bay;  this is a rare one.  They have huge windows to show off their best quality, the great views.  On a sunny day, it's great.  Too bad the food is only ordinary.  And it is not cheap."}
{"review":"My first time visiting this restaurant while staying at the nearby Hilton, I walked over on Monday for lunch. Being solo, I chose to sit at the bar. Immediately I was greeted  by a very nice server, she gave me a menu, water and a...beer.  Then she told me that the bartender would be right with me, which she was, and she was equally as nice and accommodating. I could tell the first server had her own section on the floor, but every time she came behind the bar she refilled my water and asked if I needed anything, which I didn\u2019t because my bartender was also very attentive. The teamwork did not go unnoticed and was appreciated. \nSalmon is a favorite of mine, but I rarely order it when I eat out because I am usually disappointed. Not the case this time. The portion size was exactly what it should have been and it was cooked to perfection, juicy on the inside and just the right amount of crisp on the outside. The fries were fresh and hot and I couldn\u2019t resist trying their house made blue cheese dressing for dipping, also excellent. The meal was priced appropriately for the value. And good, cold beer on tap.\nA waterfront restaurant with amazing views is why I tried this restaurant, but I\u2019ll return, bringing my husband, for the excellent service and delicious food\u2026and the views.More"}
{"review":"The wife and I use to come here all the time. This is all she wanted, for us to finally get away from the kids . So we had 7:30 reservations. We get checked in. Hostess says it will be 5 to 10 min wait.....We get drinks from the bar. 30 mins pass.We check in with the hostess once again \nshe said it would be another 30-40 minute. There's nobody in the waiting room to be seated.By that point it way 8:30 every restaurant is closing down. We went to Hanna Japan just so we could eat something. The  customer service was really great there. Thank you for the great evening!More"}
{"review":"This was my absolute favorite meal, my entire visit to the Bay area ! The view was breath taking ! We watched the sun set and the sail boats float by.  The service was impeccable! Our waitress was on point and the food was so...wonderful .  From the presentation to all the mouth watering flavors, we were thoroughly satisfied.  We had the best oysters here ! They melt in your mouth and the mussels in sauce...and the seared tuna !! It was all fabulous, as well as many cocktail options.\nThis will be a must when I am in the area again. Thank you so much !More"}
{"review":"My experience with this restaurant is very helpful, great services, and  the meal looks fanatic. its make me want to go back love it."}
{"review":"This restaurant has huge open windows that look out directly at the Golden Gate Bridge plus lots of the Bay.  You can sit in the window, or in one of the raised booths and have completely unobstructed views.  Splendid.  We wanted to enjoy our lunch...but found the food underwhelming, especially the undercooked French fries.  Great menu with lots of tempting choices, but the execution was just ordinary.More"}
{"review":"We had a great late lunch at Skates before move-in day at Berkeley. This was our first time here (coming from the east coast) and had read great reviews of this classic restaurant. We were not disappointed!  We used OpenTable and had no time getting...a time slot for two at short notice. \n\nService was great. Our server was very pleasant, professional, and responsive.  Our orders came out promptly and were prepared as we requested.  \n\nThe lunch menu had great variety and something for everyone. My vegetarian\/pescatarian daughter had no problem finding something for her and greatly enjoyed her salmon BLTA.  I had a great open-faced crab sandwich. They have a decent beer list, although a few of their more local brews were not available at the time.  The cocktail list looked very tempting. \n\nThe place appears to have a great amount of seating for various sized parties. Smaller two-tops are available along the windows with a fantastic view of the bay. We could clearly see the Bay Bridge and Golden Gate Bridge off in the distance. \n\nI\u2019d say it\u2019s a pretty upscale venue, with pretty well-dressed customers. However, we didn\u2019t have any problems being a little more casual before dorm move-in day and it being lunch. But I\u2019d personally say business casual or more dressy clothes would fit in. Despite it being an old-school traditional restaurant, it is appointed in a very modern style and has a creative menu with traditional options. \n\nWhen we come back to Berkeley, we will visit Skates again!More"}
{"review":"Aylor's is by far our favorite place to dine out in Sausalito.   Sea and the staff are professional and fun, the food ism great and the margaritas amazing."}
{"review":"My wife and I were here on a business trip and found this restaurant in the Sausalito visitor map. I looked it up on here and decided to make a reservation for 4 pm after landing at SFO. \nWe loved our meal! Our server was...Ricardo and he was very helpful and animated in helping us pick the best dishes!!!\nWe each ordered a drink. My wife lived her Mexican colada and my jalape\u00f1o margarita was amazing!\nWe had queso and chips and salsa\u2026\u2026yummy!\nWe each ordered combos for our dinner. A Chile relleno and cheese enchilada. My wife had chicken enchiladas. We wish we would\u2019ve had room for the tres leches!\nI hope to go back soon!!!!!More"}
{"review":"We dined here two nights in a row on our stay in the San Francisco area. The food is tremendous. Freshly prepared. Every day there are specialty menu items along with the standard items. We especially loved the traditional chips and salsa. Easily the best...salsa I have had. Perfectly balanced with just the right amount of kick. The staff is fantastic. Met the chef both nights. This place is alive and feels like home.More"}
{"review":"Best Clam Chowder!\nThe chowder here is so delicious. It is a thinner soup, unlike the thick heavy versions elsewhere. The dining area is rustic and traditional. Definitely a place to have a more elevated experience. Saying that, there is outdoor space to enjoy a...casual lunch or evening too. The staff is attentive and the variety of seafood dishes are abundant. I love coming here with family, friends or even business.More"}
{"review":"TravelGirl, We are so glad you were able to dine with us and during this crazy times. Honored that we are one of your favorites to bring family and friends."}
{"review":"Excellent food, great service, reasonable prices in a fun atmosphere.  Convenient location with parking in the rear."}
{"review":"Jdh, Thank you for taking the time and giving us 5 stars! So happy that you enjoyed your meal and service."}
{"review":"The food is very good and authentic anyone that gives this restaurant anything but top ratings is a fool the management has worked very hard to hire the best people to give the very best service. The margaritas are the best in the Bay Area...and anyone that is familiar with Sausalito knows how great the margaritas are. The staff is always smiling and makes you feel welcome. Once you enter the restaurant you will think you are in a beach town in Mexico. You can order anything on the menu and you will be quite pleased. Anyone that does not give this establishment top billing does not know great Mexican food.\nI did have a great evening and I enjoyed our waiter.\nThanks Richie BayneMore"}
{"review":"My husband and I visited California for the first time last month. We stayed in Sausalito area and traveled from there. We had a great visit! The best meal we had was at Saylors. The service was excellant! The food was served not and plentiful!...The funny part of the story we thought we were going to a seafood restaurant! My husband got a seafood burrito which was huge! My chicken burrito was also delicious. So glad we discovered this quaint Mexican restaurant!More"}
{"review":"This is a great place for Mexican food, and the best in Southern Marin. It is very popular with the locals (like us). The food is really good, the value is excellent, and the service is exceptional!  Rico, our waiter all the time, should be...in a four star restaurant.More"}
{"review":"Stopped here last night after a touristy day in the city. We arrived quite late and hungry, and the restaurant was busy so we were a little nervous that there would be a long wait. But we were wrong - service was immediate and food...and drinks were delivered very quickly.  The atmosphere was quite authentic and the servers were unbelievable friendly and humorous and tolerated my lame efforts at Spanish. \n\nWe ordered enchiladas and and the burritos and operations for large and flavors were fantastic. Highly recommend this place and would go back anytime we\u2019re in Sausalito.More"}
{"review":"We had an awesome time here. The food was good, the margaritas were good and the service was amazing. If I lived in Sausalito, I'd be here all the time."}
{"review":"If your looking for great food, the best service, and a great bartender look no further. Stop into saylors restaurant. Fajitas, tacos, burritos and margaritas are the to do for. My family goes here regularly and this fun atmosphere makes the entire dining experience wonderful....And it's affordable!More"}
{"review":"If you come alone, you won't feel alone for very long, it's a great place to feel like a local. Not only do they have great Mexican (Blackened Salmon Tacos are amazing or the Cabo Prawns) so much to choose from, they also have excellent...hamburgers and you can find pasta or steak on the menu. Make sure you save room for dessert the Sopapillas or Bananas Borrachas are few of my favorites. Family friendly and they have outdoor seating in nice weather.More"}
{"review":"Rather than spend an hour in grid lock of the main drag on a weekend we opted for a side street with this Interesting little restaurant \nService was very attentive with the waiter & busboys insuring our drinks were topped & the nacho bowl never...was empty. I found the menu amusing as a Mexican pasta especiale was an Italian cioppino that was chock a block with many different varieties of fish and clams. The Baja tacos were also a hit. Parking as stated can be tricky but  is worth the effort. Finally the price point for the area is very affordable.More"}
{"review":"Good, solid, old school Mexican food at a very fair price.  Good enchiladas along with with some Cabo inspired fish tacos.  Excellent guacamole, and the beer prices say we value you as a customer.  A great value and a welcoming place where the food is...quite good.  It is much better than the other Mexican places in town, particularly the over priced and over touristy, Copitas. We come here every few weeks and have always had a good meal.More"}
{"review":"Best Mexican food in Marin; lots of American food choices too! Best lunch dinner menu in Marin. Best Bar and Happy Hour! This is a favorite Sausalito locals spot. Kid friendly."}
